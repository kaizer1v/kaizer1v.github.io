## CivicDataLab Feedback Session

_26th May, 2019_

Hello Everyone,

  Thank you very much for the valuable feedback. It has surely helped me identify some of the key things to focus on.


### Top Problems/Challenges

**Communication**
  - Doesn't involve himself enough into projects and other work as well
  - Expects work to be given, doesn't proactively takes up something and solves
  - Speaks mostly when spoken to
  - When not in person, pro-activeness dies, talks less, gives less ideas
  - Doesn't share the thought process behind doing something
  - Doesn't share/update when there's a challenge/problem. Goes into silo mode
  - Doesn't showcase his opinion
  - Mostly keeps to himself and his work (kaam se kaam)

**Identity**
  - Doesn't have anything unique about the work I do
  - Always keen on taking everything up (not a good thing)

**Work**
  - Doesn't evaluate the work I am doing myself
  - Doesn't say no very often
  - **There is no concrete output in the last 2 months**
  - The problem statement and the intent of `why` we are doing something, is somehow not being registered into his head
  - Is not a subject matter expert at one thing
  - 


### Top Attribues/Positives

**Energy**
  - Have a lot of enthusiasm
  - Initially shares a lot of ideas - on let's do this & that
  - Open to new and challenging things
  - Calm and patient
  - It is easy to communicate with me, people feel comfortable

**Work**
  - What are the road blocks on my priorities?

### Course of Action

* How I think and solve problems need to change
* What is demanding is - You should have your way of doing things
* My activities and decisions are showcasing that my interests and what I am working on are in opposite directions
* My priorities aren't straight
  - Create a goal setting and a priority list & share it with everyone / visible to everyone
    1. Hi-fi designs for the website specifically
      1a. 
* They expect that I should have a unique way of doing things
* There's a sense of feeling that I am not easy to collaborate with
* It would be better if I evaluate the kind of work I am doing
* Documentation is thorough but need to improve structuring
* Take up stuff on your trajectory
* Build and collate research tools & techniques & a glossary of good techniques, frameworks to use
* There needs to be constant improvement
* Getting things done / Agile deliverables
* Curate list of people who align with your vision and org's vision and learn from them


### Questions

- Set your own priorities & communicate them
- Note on "Why was there nothing produced in the last 2 months?"
- What do you mean by "Agile Deliverables"?
- What are the things that I am uncomfortable with?


### Work Ethic

- That would mean we won't be able to add anything top of the API
  => work with consortium of team
- Sectorial intervention analytical tool
  =>

## Gramener - Feedback from Anand

> _"My communication skills showcase a much larger image of what is in real."_ - S Anand

According to him

### Strengths

- UI
- A broad range of interests
- Capability incline towards being a business analyst
- strive for quality output

### Weaknesses

- Overwhelmed when struck with large amounts of information
  = the ability to break large chunks into smaller stuff and master it, continuously
- Assume you will be able to do it
- Neglecting the nuances of **how** something works
- Product Architecture kind of stuff or building a compiler - I can't
- Persistence & scale is a problem
- Persistence: sheer grit, sheer effort (bare pain, let go of ego)
- Scale: larger to do things
- Lack the **descipline** to do within a timeline


### Course of Action

- Don't commit to anything for more than a week
  = Will help you build tenacity
- Always take other's help in making plans
  = Say no - I am unable to plan for more than a week
  = Say no to yourself that I will not be able to commit to more than a week
- Take up something that you hate - this will build a discipline in you (eg: testing)

## Self Analysis

Here are some of the points that I have observed and noted myself

### Problems I had in school (an attempt to look into myself and solve my own problems first)

* Didn't concentrate on accuracy, but speed instead
* Teachers said: I was always in a hurry for some reason
* If there were a problem given to me which I had solved earlier, I would know it, but if that problem were slightly twisted, I wasn't able to solve it, specifically in Mathematics
* I never could sit and study continuously for more than an hour
* Social attitude towards others were quite negative, I sometimes showed hatred towards the people who even **tried** to like me
* I used to say **yes** to almost everything. I never gave priority to myself or had my priorities right, I always agreed to what my friends said
* I sometimes, lied to others and i was indirectly lying to myself.
* I never set goals for myself or concentrated on what I want - simply ran like a rat.
* I never revised anything

### Some Positives

* I honstely care about providing simplified solutions to people
* Here are a few set of problems intrigue me
  - The current way we try to find a house -> navigate yourself and find one.


### Course of Action

- Get your priorities straight - accuracy first, speed 2nd
- Beyond those 2, you need to have a greater goal
- Try and understand the fundamentals of solving a problem, don't memorise a solution
- Concentration and the passion to solve something was not there.
- Don't lie
- The only way to stick to your goals is to stick to it everyday
- Sometimes, it is important to look back on what i did last week and simply revise/run through that
