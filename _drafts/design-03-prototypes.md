## Rules of prototyping


### 1. Make it quickly

It **HAS** to be quick and dirty, that's the whole point. You should be able to make it as fast as possible, with whatever resources you may have and can be as dirty as it might seem.


### 2. Make many

Variations help get better feedback. When you show multiple choices, people tend to choose the good features out of all of them. Also helps you figure out what NOT to keep, in a much more effective way


### 3. Provide only essential details

Only focus on the things that are **ABSOLUTELY** necessary. At the prototyping stage, don't bother about additional features. Stick to your [opportunity areas]() that you defined earlier


You could multiple methods of prototyping, based on the kind of "experience" you are trying to solve.

For example, when trying to solve for _"HMW be able to improve depositing cash using an ATM machine?"_, you would actually want to build a cardboard based ATM machine and have a person sit inside of it to respond to the user's interactions.

In case of trying to solve for _"HMW improve then online job application experience on job portals & other websites?"_, you can use paper prototypes mimicing the interface as hand drawn images for each screen.

And in case of trying to understand different challenges a passenger faces when they are _"trying to commute on a train as a tourist"_, you can use role plays where you assign a person to play the character - with a characteristic and situation and he/she enacts naturally and while doing so, other observers / designers try and understand the challenges the actor faces when eg: 'trying to ask for where can he buy a bottle of water on the train - without able to speak english.'
