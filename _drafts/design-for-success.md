It's been a while since I have been trying to follow my principle of

> Habit is the absolute way to success

and I wanted to compare and improve some of my time management and work principles with some of the known ones out there. Hopefully, I will be able to imbibe some of them into my routine as well.

So, a quick google search on the some of the habits of successful people, here is what I found

- Proactive
- Focus
- Passion to Succeed
- Time Management
- Knowing Priorities

Here's what **Elon Musk** has to say

- Avoiding phone calls lets him stick to his own schedule
- Trying to multitask when on the bus ride or
- Breaking time slots into 5 minutes (Tiny and Achievable)
- Continuously improving and learning
- Understand the _why_ - applying basic principles
- Get enough sleep

Some from the great **Leonardo Da Vinci**

- Writing a journal to record ideas, thoughts, inspiration
- Courage and Persistence and sheer grit. He even wrote strong statements like _Obstacles do not bend me._ and _Every obstacle is destroyed through rigor._ to motivate himself


Infact, there are millions and millions of things that people talk about when it comes to successful habits, being highly effective and a thousand ways to manage your time and prioritize and work and being productive.

And after reading and researching through it, here's a list of my most top priorities of things to do and ways to design your day around what you want to achieve

1. **Fitness** - Don't write cheques that your body can't cash. If the mind has to perform at it's peak, your body should enable it to do that.
2. 


## Some of the challenges I face everyday are

1. I find it hard to complete projects and tasks spanning across weeks after beginning
2. I also find it hard to concentrate on something for longer duration
3. When overwhelmed with work or trying to solve a complex problem, I find it hard to focus on a few important things help tackle larger problems.

## Techniques that I learned which can be applied to overcome my challenges

Challenge 1: Completing projects
Tricks to overcome:

  * Try and use the pomodoro technique to get rid of procrastination
  * Understanding the problem is more important than simply jumping into solution building
  * Remember the reason of continuity - it strengthens the neural network in the brain
  * Revisiting and reviewing routinely also strengthens the idea developed within the brain
  * Try and deal with not more than 4 things at a time

Challenge 2: Concentration and procastination
Tricks to overcome:

  * Again, use the pomodoro technique for 25 minutes followed by a 10 minute break
  * Also along the duration of the task - turn off all distractions
  * Exercise and good sleep also keeps the mind fresh the next day

Challenge 3: Overwhelmed with work / Trying to solve complex problems
Tricks to overcome:

  * Understand the fundamentals and build neural connections and don't memorize
  * Buildling chunks to help develop connections between chunks will help retain the complex idea better rather than remembering them in isolation
