# Principles

**Direction Over Speed**
If you’re locked on to your desired destination, all progress is positive, no matter how slow you’re going


**Live Deliberately**
Set time aside today to pursue your dreams. Start today to learn the things you’d like to know. Reach out today to repair that strained relationship. Today, jettison the dead weight that’s holding you down.


**Thoughtful Opinions Held Loosely**
How do you respond when you’re faced with facts that contradict a sometimes long-held and cherished belief? None of us have a perfect understanding of the world we live in. As our understanding increases, we must be willing to adapt and change if we are to learn and grow to position ourselves to lead the life we want to live.


**Principles Outlive Tactics**
By understanding the principles that shape your reality, your “why” will more accurately guide your thoughts and actions.


**Own Your Actions**
When we refuse to accept ownership of our mistakes, we’ve warped the feedback loop we rely on to make better decisions in the future. If we are the common denominators in all the problems that vex us, but we fail to understand that, nothing will ever change.
