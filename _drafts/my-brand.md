# My Brand

A brand tries to tell the character of an organisation, team or even a person.

I decided to brand myself. This is how I did it


## Principles & Values

There are somethings that I truly believe in and follow. Often, for people, it would be what your parents taught you when you were a kid growing up. These values were embeded in me to make me who I am today. Yes, there have been many external influences by which I have wavered myself into doing things I shouldn't have or things that drove me away from the principles. But, overall I truly believe in these principles.

* Be a good human being first
* Trust yourself and believe in yourself
* Always work smart & put everything into it

  > If you want to be a cobbler, be the best cobbler.
