I wanted to understand what interaction design really means, so decided to try and understand it from a humane point of view.

Let's take an action that we perform probably on an every day basis - "Choose One"

## Choose One

The action of choosing one - is probably where the element "radio button" came into place. For example, on a daily basis, here are the times when I do a _radio button_ in real life

* When picking a spoon from the spoon stand
* Picking up the key when going out
* Choosing the right pair of shoes / socks
* Picking the right shirt / watch / belt / pants
* Sometimes even choosing the right song on Spotify
* Sometimes when playing the ring-toss game (but only a single chance)

Let's look at the anatomy of choosing one and then try to replicate it on a digital medium.

### Anatomy

1. There are a bunch of things visible to me
2. I know I only need to pick 1
3. I pick one
4. I know what I picked / verify whether I picked the right one


I have tried and replicated the interaction that acts like a radio button, essentially allows you to **choose one** from a list of options.

Essentially, this is what I think interaction design fundamentally means, albeit a very naive example for this, but tries to capture the idea of how to think about interactions.
