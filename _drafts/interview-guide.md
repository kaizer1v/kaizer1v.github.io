## The Guide

**Location**

* The event venue for [Analysis of the Transit Data in Bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/DataKind-Bangalore/events/262356567/), Robert BOSCH office, during an event organised by DataKind, Bangalore.

**Equipments**

- Notebook
- Pen / Pencil
- Laptop

_Unfortunately, since I thought, the event would be the best place to meet many people first hand to talk about commute problems in Bangalore, I couldn't audio record our conversations because of group activities_

**Setup**

The best thing about the setup was that I was attending a local event, whose primary motive was itself to talk about commute problems in Bangalore, India - the city where I live. Also, since this event was prescheduled, I had enough time to prepare for my interview questions and approach anyone I wanted to from the approx 50 - 60 people who attended the event.

P.S. I am also a volunteer for **DataKind Bangalore** group, giving me enough confidence to approach anyone I wanted to. :)

### Intro & Participant Background

Hello, I am Vivek, a volunteer from DataKind. I am currently trying to understand the commute problems in Bangalore from various people and how can we help commuters to improve their commuting experience.


### Overview Questions

1. Can you tell me about yourself, what you do and where you are from?
2. How long have you been in this city? **Trying to understand if they are familiar with their available options**
3. How often do you commute & where to?
4. Do you own any vehicle like a two-wheeler, a car or a bicycle? **Trying to understand their typical choice & behaviour**
  - 4a. What kind of (_vehicle_)? **Their default choice**
5. Do you use any public transportation in the city? Like the metro or the bus?
  5a. When was the last time you used it & for what?
6. Have you used cab services like Uber or Ola (An Indian app just like uber)?
  6a. When & where?
7. Tell me about a time when you used _one of the above_ and why. **Try and understand what their goal was and why did they used that mode of transport**
  7a. How long did it take you to reach _their goal_


### Explore

1. Approximately how many times in the previous month did you use the _mode of transport_?
2. You mentioned that you used _mode of transport_ to get _their goal_. Could you run me through the steps you took to get _their goal_?
3. Why did you choose _one mode_ and not the _other mode_?
4. Do you usually commute alone in order to _their goal_? Why?
5. Can you tell me about a time of your commute that really frustrated you? Why?
6. Can you tell me about a time when you really enjoyed your commute? What made it enjoyable?


### Closing Notes

* It was great talking to you and thank you so much for your time.
* Do you have any further questions you may have that I can answer?
* Rewarding them


## Reflection

What did you learn about interviewing participants to find design opportunities? What would you do differently next time?

- People always find their own ways to utilise their time very effectively. In the interview the candidate mentioned that she cycled to work and used that commute time to listen to podcasts. I could have asked the problems associated to listening to podcasts without them getting distracted. Something like providing them noise reduction headphones.

- The second candidate mentioned that he had to use his car because the effort he had to put in order to take a cheaper option of public transport was too time consuming for him. It made me think in problems which were much larger than my scope - like improving the bus route system so that it isn't that time consuming.

- I also learned, that although people have challenges which is far larger than their own, there still are tiny obvious things that can be done, iteratively in order to improve the experience of commuting.

I would surely record the interviews I conduct next time so that I an refer them back without my notes.
