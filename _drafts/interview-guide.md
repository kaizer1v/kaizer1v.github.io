## The Guide

**Location**

* The event venue for [Analysis of the Transit Data in Bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/DataKind-Bangalore/events/262356567/), Robert BOSCH office, during an event organised by DataKind, Bangalore.

**Equipments**

- Notebook
- Pen / Pencil
- Laptop

_Unfortunately, since I thought, the event would be the best place to meet many people first hand to talk about commute problems in Bangalore, I couldn't audio record our conversations because of group activities_

**Setup**

The best thing about the setup was that I was attending a local event, whose primary motive was itself to talk about commute problems in Bangalore, India - the city where I live. Also, since this event was prescheduled, I had enough time to prepare for my interview questions and approach anyone I wanted to from the approx 50 - 60 people who attended the event.

P.S. I am also a volunteer for **DataKind Bangalore** group, giving me enough confidence to approach anyone I wanted to. :)
