title: A Fresh Start
---

There's been a significant step in my career and in my personal life a last year (April 2020). That signifcant event has caused a lot of clarity in my head with respect to what I want to achieve and how I want to achieve it in the future. The happy moment was - I joined SAP as a User Experience Design Specialist in April 2020. Today marks an year to that journey.

But a little rewind to know how I actually got here (if you are interested).

In 2019 January, I got married. I was jobless at the time and was fairly clueless about what I want to do ahead; let alone the pressure of thinking how to sustain my living with a partner who was also jobless at the time. My wife had also switched her career path and starting afresh - moving from analytics to marketing. She successfully joined as a Digital Marketing Planner at a well known firm in that domain within a few months of our wedding. But I was still uncertain about my path & jobless.

At the core of my being - I am a very technical person. My college degree taught me how to be a programmer - thats what I have lived as, most of my career. Everything revolved arond coding. If I saw a product, first thought - _"What tech stack have they used?"_, _"How is it built?"_. If I had an idea, the first thought was _"How would I code it?"_ or _"what libraries would I use?"_ instead of trying to think _"Why build this in the first place?"_ or _"How are people solving that problem TODAY?"_. I mostly worked with UI and front-end technologies. It's very clear, problem solving and business understanding was something I didn't have experience in - at all. Prior to my wedding, I had worked with Gramener as a Tech Lead, working on providing data visualiation dashboard to clients - as a Technical Lead in various projects (for 2 years) and quite a few [lessons I learned](https://kaizer1v.github.io/2020/01/07/lessons-at-gramener/) there. Before that, I was fighting really hard as a front-end engineer and trying to switch my career path into UX Design, including 3 failed attempts to get into India's best design schools & as well failed attempts in moving internally in UX teams working at Symantec & Informatica. Design wasn't really clear to me.

Luckily right after my wedding, an acquaintance of mine from volunteering experience days at [DataKind Bangalore](https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-blr), was very kind to offer me to help his new venture [CivicDataLab](https://www.civicdatalab.in) - as a UX Fellow. This gave me the opportunity to put myself in the shoes of a "Designer", of which I knew fairly little. I would also like to thank Rasagy who acted as my mentor in this path of figuring it out. Can't be more grateful to CivicDataLab's team enough.

Ofcourse, programming was hard to detach from. I was still thinking in code - this really didn't add a lot of value when working on trying to design an open data platform to access India's judicial data. And very soon, 6 months in that role, I was feeling uneasy and decided to move out. I was jobless again, back to square one. By now, my wife was well settled in to her new digital marketing role and was solely the only positive energy around me.

> When you are both jobless & clueless - the best thing to invest in is education.

In August of 2020, I came across a 6 month online course being offered by UpGrad called "Product Management" (_from a weekend football teammate of mine - what are the odds. Like seriously_). I got motivated about it because the first 3 months covered the basics of Design. I enrolled; diligently worked on projects; made good friends/connections (Kartik, Pratik & a few others) & learnt a lot. What it bought me was a fundamental shift in the thought process, about problem solving and how to approach it. When I finished the course, I was confident enough to apply for Product Management and Design Roles. The interview experience was tremendously fun. I learned from all the interviews & the orgnisations that offered me a role as well as the ones who rejected me.

> Never-Ever leave an interview with "No". The only answer you should leave with is either "Yes" or an explanation to "Why not".

Finally the timing was right and I interviewed at SAP's design team - and thanks to everything, I got selected. Today, April 06, 2021 - I finished an year at SAP. It's been a great journey so far and looking forward to a greater journey ahead.

On that note, I am (re)starting (re)fresh about the projects I work on, the way I work and things I write about. I am archiving all my older posts & projects.
