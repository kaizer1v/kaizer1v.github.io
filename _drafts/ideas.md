# Weekly Plans

Only make weekly plans. It's efficient. Here's a few things that you want to spend time on, in a week.

1. Job (Design) - Majority of your time is spent on doing work for your organisation, which is primary
2. Personal Projects - Spend some time everyday on working on your ideas and stuff you want to do
3. Fitness - Spend some time everyday on exercising, running or playing football in a week
4. Read - Doing an online course or Reading a book is a great way to learn something new
5. Music - Playing the Tabla or composing some music

Doing this will help create a template for reviewing your weekly tasks and eventually, a monthly review template - and eventually, an yearly review template.


# PROBLEMS

- can we use ES6 for templating directly instead of lodash?
- unsure of what design patterns to use in javascript to solve event handling
- unable to thoroughly write test cases for javascript feature development
- using navigation tell visualisation stories (ideate from reveal-js & md parser)
- there are a lot of duplicate images in pictures and also quite a few unnecessary ones
- always have to refer to the login.xl file from google docs when I need to login and don't remember my password
- There are many visualisation tools out there - need to shed some light on which are the popular ones, easy ones and how can I use them for my purposes and why (blog post)
- need to backup - restore files/folders (use: clonezilla)
- time consuming to re-install softwares and setup configurations for environment. maybe a python program to install required softwares `ubuntu_init`
  - take a list of programs from a txt file
    `sudo apt install $(grep -vE "^\s*#" software_list.txt  | tr "\n" " ")`
    and a better way than that is
    `xargs -a <(awk '! /^ *(#|$)/' "$packagelist") -r -- sudo apt install`
  - download and install them
- when you start to refactor a javascript code/file you often don't know how bad/good the code really is. It would be wonderful to visualise the code in a graphical way which shows us the count of lines, for/while loops and if/switch cases and how many variables are declared and so on. could be a eslint/jshint plugin

**Plan**
_Break the problem statement into chunk-able tasks, as specific as possible._
_Also define the metrics required to measure the progress._
_Use google calendar to add tasks and at time slots._
_Use the pomodoro technique i.e. use the iphone timer to keep track of time._
