# Learning How To Learn

This post is based on the book **A Mind For Numbers** by Barbara Oakley and a supplemented course on coursera titled [**Learning How To Learn**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)

These are notes taken from the course as well as from the book.


## How to beat procrastination

- Easiest way to beat procrastination is the pomodoro technique. It is also important to reward yourself after the 25 minutes concentrated workout.
- When learning abstract things like mathematics, practice and spaced repitition helps in strenghtening the neurons.
- The working memory has 4 slots and unless repeated often.
- Spaced repition is a good technique for practice on moving things from working memory into long term memory - and easier for later recall.
- Cramming on one day is surely not a good idea.
- Good night's sleep is also pretty helpful for removing waste information and strenghtening neurons.

- Good learning is a bit by bit activity, so spend fixed amount of time into your learning but spacing it out by starting earlier
- Don't use will power to beat procrastination, because it is really tough
- Putting off work will only damage your brain
- Beating procrastination will actually help you build delayed gratification
- Habits are energy savers - and it is a mode that you get into subconsciously and that's why you need very little energy to start working on something
- The parts of Habits are 
  * The Cue
  * The Routine
  * The Reward
  * The Belief


- It doesn't matter even if you begin with a bad feeling about something that you are about to do, but it is important how you handle those feelings.

  > Quit wasting time and get on with it.

- You can even reframe the what you are doing like

  > The process of doing it is more important than the end result.

The product is actually what is unpleseant and might cause pain in the brain.

- Time after time, the ones who are committed to maintaining their liesure along with their hard work time outperform those who doggedly persue an endless treadmill.

- Get the most important work done (one pomodoro) - the most important and most disliked task as soon as you wake up.

## Memory

Long term memory + short term (working) memory

- Try and visualise abstract concepts as much as possible.
- Repeat sporadically over the week helps retrieval of information. Flash cards can help summarise concepts. Writing and saying also enhance retention.
- Review / Revisit the things in spaced repitition, which is very improtant to strenghten the networks.
- Memory Palace - useful to remember unrelated items is a technique where you imagine a physical place you know of, and imagine walking through the place placing each item you want to remember at one place. 

- Hear, smell and visualise the things that needs to be remembered
- Creating meaningful groups that simplify the material also helps in remembering in the long term.

**Brain Facts**

- Hippocampus is important part of the brain for remembering facts and learning
- Astrocytes


## Chunking

- Chunking is breaking down a large bits of information into smaller meaningful bits of information, when joined together with meaning, making sense.
- The brain doesn't function effectively when stressed or angry.

### Steps to chunk

1. **Focus** undivided attention on the information to be chunked.
2. **Understand** the information that you need to chunk. Doing it yourself will actually help you understand the information better.
3. **Building context** will help you understand when to _use_ the chunk and also when _not to use_ the chunk. This is done by practicing repeatedly on related and unrelated problems. This also helps understand how your chunk fits into the bigger picture.

- Instead of re-reading the information that you want to practice on, try and recall what you already read. This is more beneficial.
- Drawing concept mapping which shows the connections between multiple chunks is a great idea to build context of the information.
- Try and recall chunks of information as much as possible.


## How to Learn Better

- Physical exercise is the best thing to do for a healthy brain
- Practice makes perfect, but when you are properly prepared
- Visualise & create metaphors and analogy for learning things that are difficult to percieve. In addition, also try and utilise all your senses to be able to undersand the concept that you are reading, like applying the concept that you are trying to learn in a practical scenario or experiment.
- Metaphors also help you get out of `Einstellung`, i.e. thinking about a problem in a wrong way.
- Once you have trained and practiced enough, there are times when you simply have to rely on the knowledge you have already practiced.
- Takihg responsibility of your learning is very essential. Go ahead and experiment the way you want to and not abide by what the _teacher_ says.
- Practice actually helps build neurons between the intention (area that stores knowledge) and imulsive behaviour (control centre).


_Depth perception is developed early in the stage of growth_
_Prefrontal cortex is involved in analysis, social behaviours & decision making & planning_

### Avoid overconfidence - teamworks is better

Left hemisphere - clings to beliefs you already have (MG - interprets the world for us)
  - overconfident
  - 
Right hemisphere - big picture perspective / doing reality checks / question status quo
  - 



### Testing

- reviewing and recalling itself is a good test to start with

**Checklist for test taking**

Q: Did you make a serious effort in understanding the text?
Q: Did you work with classmates on homework problems?
Q: Did you outline all the solutions to the problem before working with classmates?
Q: Did you participate actively in group discussions?
Q: Did you consult with your teacher when having trouble on something?
Q: Did you understand all of the homework solutions?
Q: Did you review?

- when you stuck at a difficult problem, spend just enough time & if you still can't proceed, then move on to an easier problem. This helps activate the diffuse mode to think creatively to look at the problem from a fresh perspective.

- Whenever you seem to be stressed, try and talking to yourself as to **why** you are stressed. Also, you can try and close your eyes and do a few deep breaths.

- Try and simulate the scenarios of the ultimate test environment while you are practicing.

- You can also try and reverse engineer to the answer that is required.




## Tips

- Have to be part of a group, working by yourself is quite deadly - Don't be a lone programmer
- `Engineering is a team sport`
- Make sure you have the right and updated resources to get yourself started
- Dont' lose focus on the objective - the objective in college is to **earn a degree**
- When you are taking a break, take a total cut-off break - something absolutely recreational. **Exercise**
- Saturate yourself with the different senses of the information like - **read it out loud**, **write it down** or **draw / picture it** etc. Also, in a group, you tend to challenge yourself more, so try teaching it someone else - that covers up what you think you might know, but really don't.


- Focused mode is intentional and full concentration, where as diffused mode helps you wander to farther areas of your brain. In order to become an expert, persistantly re-visiting the paths in your focused-mode brain and making it stronger is really important. Where as if you are dealing with something new, it's good to sometimes go on the diffuse mode of thinking for a different perspective or new ideas.

- When learning a new concept, it's very important to switch between the two modes under control i.e. taking 5 - 10 minute breaks is important now and then. A few things that you can do when you are on that break is go for a run, play football, dance or play Tabla. Sleep is the ultimate diffuse mode.

- Remember, consistency over time is the key to excel at anything.

- Look outward when you are frustrated, take a step back and re-look why you are there in the first place. This is the time to get into diffuse mode. Talk to others when you are stuck at something, others perspective helps.

- When learning or dealing with abstract things, like mathematics or anything that isn't relatable phsicyally like a tangible object, it is recommended to practice it even more in order to enhance those neural patterns in your brain.

- The best way to deal with procrastination, is the pomodoro (timer for 25 mins) helps. You should also read this [article by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/akrasia).

- There are two conecpets of memory in our brains. The long-term and the working memory (pre-dominantly the pre-frontal cortex). Practice is the only way to put things inside your long-term memory and it takes time. **Spaced Repitition** is a good technique to put it in long-term memory. It suggests that instead of practicing a lot on one day, space it throughout a week and do it on _Mon -> Tue -> Wed -> Fri -> Sun_

- Sleep is healthy. Also - it's helpful even more if you are in focused mode right before you sleep.

- Dealing with boring lecture - Ask a question, because active engagement is more effective for learning than passive engagement.

- Being in a creative environment, makes you more creative. Just like, playing football with better players, makes you a better player - _Zidane_. So, the **people** and the **environment** helps you stay creative on a day-to-day basis.

- **Chunks** are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning, like compacting key ideas or actions put together. Chunks are formed by doing three main things

  1. Having **focused attention** when trying to learn something new
  2. Deep **understanding** of the concept that you are trying to learn
  3. **Practicing** of the material repeatedly
  4. Recalling the material after learning strengthens the neural patterns. Try doing this in different environments from the one that you learnt it the first time - this helps gain confidence.
  5. When you build chunks, it becomes easier to **transfer** the concepts learnt from one field and implement it into another.
  6. Interleaving practice, which means, practicing different concepts and techniques in one session will help you master the material

- Try using some the below techniques that will avoid fooling yourself when learning new materials
  
  1. Test and question yourself after learning new material
  2. Don't keep practicing only a single type of material, this can build an illusion that you have learnt the complete subject


## Complete Summary

- Spaced repitition learning is a very affective way of planning and repeating yourself.
- Test yourself by trying to answer a question without looking at the answer. Try and recall first what you even learned and only then open the material.
- Review and plan ahead a night before.
- Sleep is important.
- Review the material first, scan through it first and understand the overview. If you are solving a problem, it helps to start with the tough ones first.
- Always exhaust all your senses when you are learning something new. Speak it out loud, feel it & best way to learn is to teach it to others. You can use some effective memory techniques like memory palace, visualisation & building metaphors.
- Pomodoro is the best way to beat procrastination. Just do it for 25 minutes & don't forget to reward yourself at the end of it.
- Believe in yourself and always think positive.
- Worrying kills creativity - so relax, medidate, say positive things to yourself.
