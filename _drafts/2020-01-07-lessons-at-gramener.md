A great company to work for. Provides the opportunities make decisions with data


### 1/ Avoid creativity fogging

Don't let work pressure spoil creativity. It spoils mood and emotions. Just **solve it** & that means

- Avoid negative conversations
- Avoid negative people
- Avoid negative time consumption


### 2/ Everything can be scoped

Never fear the time-crunch and effort needed to avoid projects. Always focus on MVP 


### 3/ MVP to communicate

MVP isn't always idea. Thus, it's a minimal product. It doesn't need to have the best, high-quality code. It should, and should only **communicate progress**


### 4/ Leaders get it done

Never take the burden of doing everything yourself. Divide equally & race against time equally


### 5/ Time the goals

A goal in itself isn't really useful, unless you know how much time it needs to be done in. Also, communicate to the team - everyday


### 6/ Fail fast

If a team member isn't really fruitful, just move them and get someone else - FAST. If something isn't working - just move on and get back to it later - FAST


### 7/ Progress & communication should ALWAYS be visible

In any way possible, I should always be moving ahead - one step at a time, but never stopping. Also, always communicate the progress too. These are key things when scaling really fast
