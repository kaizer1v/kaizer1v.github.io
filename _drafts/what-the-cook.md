# WTC - What The Cook

Every morning, at 7:30, I am half sleepy and the cook walks in and asks - _"What do I cook today?"_

This is a problem.

- Most of the time, I don't know what's in the refigerator
- I don't remember if there's any leftover from yesterday that needs to be finished
- I also don't know if my wife will be having breakfast or if she has something in mind that she wants to eat OR whether or not she's going to eat in the first place
- In the back of my mind, there's always this thing of `I want to eat healthy`, but I truly don't know what's healthy
- Even if I tell the cook something healthy, she adds too much oil and spoils it. The quantity she cooks is a little too much that I need to throw it away at times.

Wow, these are quite a bit of problems
