## My Notes

- Two important things about good design are
  1. **discoverability** : Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
  2. **understanding** : What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?

- No matter what kind of product - physical, digital this book focuses on whether the product fulfils human needs while being understandable and usable.

**Industrial design**: Focuses on form and material. For the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer.

**Interaction design**: Focuses on understandability and usability. The goal is to enhance peopleâ€™s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.

**Experience Design**: Focuses on emotional impact, quality and enjoyment of the total experience.

> You are designing the way you want people to be, instead of what people really are

> Good design starts with an understanding of psychology and technology

Experience is how fondly people remember their interactions. Also, cognition and emotion are tightly intertwined, which means designers should design with both in mind.

There are 6 main psychological concepts which are applied on discoverability which are

### Fundamental Principles of Interaction

1. **Affordances**: The relationship between the object and the person. Eg:Most chairs can also be carried by a single per- son (they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong person or by a team of people. If young or relatively weak people cannot lift a chair, then for these people, the chair does not have that affordance, it does not afford lifting.

2. **Signifiers**: Just like affordance suggests _what_ actions are possible, signifiers suggests _where_ the action should take place. Signifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person. Usually visual signifiers are key for designers for providing cues for the operation of things.

3. **Constraints**: 

4. **Mappings**: It is like figuring out which switch works for which light in the room. Some of the mappings are very natural i.e. turn the steering right to turn right and left to turn left, but at some times, when you interact with the system, some mappings aren't obvious.

5. **Feedback**: Feedback should be immediate and meaningful. The dishwasher that makes a beeping sound once it is done defeats the purpose of washing the dishes in the middle of the night without disturbing anyone. It should be quick or else it leaves the user in a sense of doubt as what to do next and often they don't wait.

6. **Conceptual Model**: This is usually a highly simplified model of how something works, which doesn't have to be accurate or even complete. They are just like mental models i.e. the conceptual model is like a prototype trying to match a user's mental model, their expectation of _how_ it should be. They help in predict how things will behave as well as what to do when things go unplanned.

There are three conceptual model of the same product

1. The designer's mental model
2. The user's mental model
3. The system image (the product itself)

The designer's job is to understand the user's mental model and match it with the system image.

### A Designer's Challenge

Design requires the cooperative efforts of multiple disciplines. Each discipline has a different perspective of the relative importance of the many factors that make up a product. One discipline argues that it must be usable and understandable, another that it must be attractive, yet another that it has to be affordable. Moreover, the device has to be reliable, be able to be manufactured and serviced. Finally it has to be usable by the user.

The gap between the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation needs to be closer. That is what a designer should do. It's basically by providing a good conceptual model and immediate and valuable feedback on the user's action.
