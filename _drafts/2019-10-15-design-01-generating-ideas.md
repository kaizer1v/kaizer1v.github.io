This activity contains a topic for generating ideas, following some rules in order to achieve the targets.

**Topic**
Experience of eating breakfast on the go for teenagers who like to sleep in late on school days.


**Rules**

1. Listing ideas
2. Eliminating a constraint
3. Making an analogy
4. Exaggerating
5. Getting in the garbage


**Target**
- Get 5 ideas for each of the 5 categories & mention why it fits that category
- Select an idea for each of these criteria
  1. Most useful
  2. Most desirable
  3. Easiest to use
  4. Most functional
  5. Most sustainable


### Listing Ideas

> A random list of things that come to your head as fast as possible

- pack and take the breakfast, eat in bus
- sip through bottle when riding cycle
- eat while running
- eat in liquid form from a bottle
- packed and dispose-able


### Eliminating a Constraint

> A **constraint** is something like _money, for the parents to spend on breakfast_, or _teenagers don't necessarily need to eat healthy food_ etc.

I chose to eliminate _eating in the class_ as a constraint. Assuming that schools allow children to eat breakfast in the class

- opt to get breakfast in class
- ship breakfast from house to class while the kid commutes
- all students share their breakfast and eat
- get breakfast delivered


### Making an Analogy

> What if eating breakfast is like _brushing your teeth_ or _taking a shower_ or even _picking up the paper in the morning_. Using an analogy - come up with ideas

I picked the analogy of _homework_

- teacher checks with parent if kid had breakfast
- all kids made to do breakfast home work first
- ask students to write/tell about their breakfast
- take a picture and share on social media & teacher checks
- 


### Exaggerate

> Taking it to the extreme, like for example, _teenagers only have 10 seconds to finish breakfast_ or _need to finish breakfast in 10 bites_ or even _1000 calories to burn_ etc.

- drinking breakfast
- small capsules to swallow
- 


### Get in the Garbage

> Some really bad ideas that you can dispose them off

- run and eat
- bus conductor provides breakfast for all
- eat when showering
- eat when dressing


## Synthesis

Let's look at the ideas and categorise them into categories

1. **Most useful**
  - get done with eating when getting dressed

2. **Most desirable**
  - take capsules to finish under 10 seconds. Teenagers extremely want this because they hate sitting and eating cereal that they don't want to eat. 
  - they also take a lot of time to consume food
  - most of the times, breakfast food is something they don't like milk or oats

3. **Easiest to use**
  - drinking breakfast

4. **Most functional**
  - Capsules or suppliments

5. **Most sustainable**
  - teachers checking whether students had breakfast via parents


## Reflections

* Following the aforementioned [rules](#rules) are a great way of listing ideas
* Using a timer for (10 minutes is a good time) to come up with five ideas each also helps you think faster
* Doing the activity in a group brings in a lot more perspective than one can imagine
* Also, having a category called **Most Secure** for the user
