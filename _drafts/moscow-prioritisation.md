# MoSCoW Prioritisation Technique

This technique is very helpful when you have many things to be done, but little time. This method will help you prioritise what needs to be tackled first and what can be tackled later.

* **M** - Must have (Minimum usable subset)
* **S** - Should have ()
* **C** - Could have
* **W** - Won't have

## Must Have

Things to remember / consider when listing it under must have

* Absolutely cannot do without i.e. no point in proceeding further without this
* Cannot deliver a viable solution without this

## Should Have

* Important but not vital
* Maybe painful to leave out, but the solution is still visible
* May need some kind of work-around, to make it simpler to execute so that it could move into the must have.

## Could Have

* Desirable, but can be left out
* Less impactful, but would be nice to have
* Something that can have a "oh wow" moment if added

## Won't Have

* Would be too difficult to implement given the time
* Something that is completely off topic
