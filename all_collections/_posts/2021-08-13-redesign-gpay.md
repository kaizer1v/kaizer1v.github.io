* Have you found it hard to make a payment using google pay?
* Do you also wonder how much you've spent on food and travel over the last month?
* Is it frustrating to recall who that contact is you've made payment to?

## The Challenge

Well, as a Google pay user, I've certainly had these challenges while using the app. over 80% of google pay users use the app to make a payment to a business in India. This is certainly a huge number of people having trouble finding the QR code scanner or wondering who they made their last payment to.

## The Goal

The goal is to help users more aware of their payments and help make transactions much faster and easier.

## The Approach

Firstly, let's identify the kind of user who we are solving for

#### Persona
* An average person who makes payments using google pay for daily necessities like groceries, medicinces and paying bills
* The user is well versed within using a smart-phone and has good internet coverage

#### Assumptions
* We are assuming that the most used feature on Google Pay is to make a payment using a QR code

#### How are people using it right now?
Based on my observations and speaking with a few people, I've understood the flow in which a person uses Google Pay at a grocery store after making their purchase

1. Current user flow
2. Open app
3. Enter passcode
4. Click “New Payment”
5. Select QR Code option out of the 3 other options 🚨
6. Again sub-select the next option 🚨
7. Scan the code
8. Enter the amount + description 🚨
9. Maybe - confirm the amount sending
10. Click “send”
11. Enter passcode
12. Get payment confirmation

> Did you know that on Google Pay's app, when you swipe right on the home page, you enable the camera to scan the QR code?

🚨 Well, most people do not know about this feature! Why? Because, the tendency of a person when using google pay is to concentrate on making the payment rather than exploring and finding easter eggs! When a user doesn't know this, they tend to click on "New Payment" to initiate the payment

🚨 After initiation, there are 4 options that the user has to choose from, and then a sub-menu when choosing "Scan QR Code". This makes it time consuming (an additional 2 to 3 seconds) and some cognitive load to perform their task of making a payment

🚨 The description being entered doesn't have value after it's been added at that time. This could be used better for the user to either tag or make it searchable at a later point in time


## The Solution
