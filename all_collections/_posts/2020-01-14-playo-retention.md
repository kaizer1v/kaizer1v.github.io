How could I improve user experience for recurring users?

If one were to segment users based on behaviours for a particular sport i.e. football, Playo would typically have

1. Finding a team
2. Finding members
3. Booking a court

A revenue is generated when a user completes the transaction of booking a court successfully. Thus, the top priority should be to make users book courts.

## Booking a court

For the sake of the below scenario, I refer to the users as *I*.

### Scenario 1 - I know the place & time

_Assuming that I have players._

The user knows where and when to play. It could be possible, he/she may already have booked a similar slot earlier. This could be a recurring slot when he/she plays regularly.

The main objective is to book the court for the desired time slot.

#### Solution

Hypothesis - users who play regularly, usually book the same court at least 5 times consecutively.

* **Re-book** - This feature to accelerate speed of court booking (improving booking speed & UX). This improves retention of regular players
* **Favourites** - Allowing me to short-list courts which I can access/search faster for later use
* **Next Available Slot** - A faster way to find me the next available slot. (_Next step would be auto book it_)

### Scenario 2 - I need to find a court 

_Assuming I have the players and I know the time._

Here, I would initiate the search by timeslot. This search would only give me courts available as per the time-slot

The objective is to find book a court within a desired time period (*T&C Apply*)

#### Solution

* **Smart Listing** - Provided the locality/area/preference the search results would prioritise closest court first.
* **Group Smart Listing** - Provided with all the player's preferences, show closest to everyone first

### Scenario 3 - I need to find a time slot

_Assuming I have players and I know the court._

Here, I would initiate the search by the court court / specific court. This search would provide me all available time slots for that court for me to book.

#### Solution

* **Next Available Slot** - A faster way to find me the next available slot. (_Next step would be auto book it_)

### Scenario 4 - I need to find players

_Assuming I know the court & time._

In this case, the search results would be shown players available for that slot / willing to play at that court & time.

#### Solution

**Book when count complete** - Book the as soon as 12 players confirm the game
