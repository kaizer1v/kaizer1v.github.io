## npm
change the directory for installing global npm packages from the default directory

`/usr/local/lib/node_modules`

to

`~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules`

So, now running something like `npm install -g eslint` with the `-g` flag i.e. install globally, then the package will be present in the `~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules` folder.

see above image for permission list of both the new and the old folders.
