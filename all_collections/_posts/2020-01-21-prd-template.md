# What is a Product Requirement Document?

Often when working on features, I had to work on quite a lot of PRDs. This is probably a boring task, but quite effective.

Here's a quote I believe in

> Always show progress and communicate the progress. ALWAYS.

As a project / team leader, you are asked

* _what's the status?_ by a superior
* _when do we start testing the app / feature?_ by product testing team
* _Could you clearly define what needs to be built?_ by developers / engineers

If you also keep finding yourself in such a spot - then write yourself a PRD.

_So, what's a PRD & what should it contain?_

## Elements of an effective PRD

An effective PRD should answer the above questions, essentially. In order to do that, you'll surely need to define the following

* **Objective / Goal** - What is it that needs to be achieved
* **KPI / Metric** - An effective milestone, if and when achieved, only then is it considered as a success. These metrics are quite essential for testing the waters
* **Assumptions** - State the assumptions in order to start the work in order to focus on the MEAT of the feature / product
* **Risk / Threats** - State all the risks like, if _...so and so..._ is not done correctly, then it can cause _...so and so..._ 
* **Time line** - Everyone wants to know how long it would take. It's a great idea to have weekly sprints (It's not too long, nor to short). At the end of each week, update the short-term and long-term deadlines. This is pretty critical for communication.


Also consider using the MoSCoW prioritisation framework, which essentially states

* **M**ust have
* **S**hould have
* **C**ould have
* **W**ould like / **W**on't have

This is a great way to prioritise features to work/not-work on when you have a list of backlogs / features / epics or user stories.


## What a PRD IS & IS NOT

Remember, the PRD doesn't necessarily mention and emphasise on "HOW" the feature would be developed. It's a hard-rule not to though. One should always provide the wireframes / visual design if they have in order to detail out the feature.

The PRD should absolutely do the following

1. Describe the purpose and functionality of the product / feature
2. Should communicate the status of the product / feature
3. Show the direction of the product / feature

But the document should definitely **NOT** do the following

1. Hold a person accountable
2. Flesh out technicalities i.e. architecture of the feature / detailed interaction etc.
