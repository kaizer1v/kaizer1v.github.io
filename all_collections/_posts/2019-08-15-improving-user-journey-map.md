This is an example of how improving the user journey flow impacts the customer experience exponentially.

Here's what had happened to one of my friend who was planning a trip to the north eastern state
. Just a week before, he realised his old camera was non functional and decided to purchase a new camera.

He decided to purchase a new camera from a popular online e-commerce platform, hoping to get it delivered before departing for his trip, the next week. He chose the cash on delivery option after placing the order and it was expected to be delivered 2 days before he was leaving for the trip.

After a couple of days, he uses the tracking number provided to check track his order on the website, but it turned out - he had to visit the courier partner's website to track his order. Doing so, he learned that the order had been delayed. He calls the customer support immediately and requests an update, but feeling unsatisfied, he tells the executive to cancel the order. The executive explains the order can't be cancelled because its a COD order (_ludicrous right?_).

Anyway, he lets it be and decides to purchase the camera from a retail store.

## How this experience could be improved

### Original flow

Here's what the original flow looked like
