# The technology you use actually affects the user

Very often I have come across Product Managers and Organisations mention that

`Users don't care what technology is at the backend or what library you use in your application's front-end, as long as they can get the job done.`

> As long as the job is done...

## Getting the job done

What does it mean?

There are some key factors to "getting the job done", which are

_"I should be able to be able to get the job done ..."_

* **Fast** - Users usually want to get it done fast, no body wants to wait
* **Confirming** - I should know, in some way, that the job is complete or incomplete or there was some kind of an issue while finishing the job
* **Documenting** - 6 months later, when I look back at this job, I should know the status of the job. It also helps the user to share this job status with other stakeholders


## So, how does it matter what technology you use - to the user?

A very key factor that designers often miss out taking into consideration while designing for the user apart from the

1. User
2. Business
3. Technology

is the **Environment** i.e. the environment in which the user is going to use the product you provide to them. For example, when designing a moblie device for a user gathering survey in the most remote areas - there are some consideration that you'll need to make when designing the phone, for example

* You'll have to take into consideration the fact that there could possibly be very less network coverage
* Remote areas and villages tend to be dirt prone, where your hands would be covered with mud or dust.
* People also aren't used to touch screens but more used to landlines and tangible buttons.
* The % of people literate in English is fairly low in these areas

When considering these factors, and building an initial prototype, you'll realise that the material you need to use for the phone should be water resistent. Thus, using a metal cover for the phone might not be a good idea. This is an example of physical technology to be considered.

Let's take a more specific example of software technology for this scenario. Consider a user using an app like "Google News". Due to shortage of network coverage, the user continues to refresh the app for updated news or suddenly is notified of an error message while reading an article about no internet connectivity. This calls for technological mechanisms like 

- Cache the information along with other some additional articles when there is connectivity. This would provide offline reading experience when lacking internet.
- Push notifications allowing the server to know whether the user is back online
- Showcasing local news based on location service

Now, in order to provide these features, a technology engineer would have to consider the right tools, programming language and libraries that allow these these features to be built with maximum efficiency.

These are some of the mechanisms where technology or the choice of platform and architecture directly impacts the user's experience.


And thus, I believe, the choice of platform, the algorithms used as well as the architecture that you use **will** matter to the user - albeit indirectly.
