There have been multiple times when I have found myself in situations where I am just not able to finish the job or just not doing it - for whatever reasons, just procrastinating or bored out of my skull.

This just hasn't been healthy for me. It has either jeopardised the work, my team members or it has ended up making me demotivated and inactive.

So, what to do when you find yourself in such situations?

[Refer to these reasons mentioned here](https://hbr.org/2014/02/how-to-make-yourself-work-when-you-just-dont-want-to)


## Reason 1

You are putting something off because you are afraid you are going to screw it up, or you feel that you are not doing it perfectly

### Solution

- Promotion focus, example, say to yourself _"If I complete this project, I will retain my job."_
- Anxiety and doubt undermine promotion motivation, leaving you less likely to take any action at all, so, DO NOT be anxious or have self doubt.
- Focus on what you have already got or what you have already done at this point.


### When to use this 

- For last minute work or something that you want to finish urgently.
- When you are in deep trouble and you think there's no way out.



## Reason 2

You are putting something off because you don’t “feel” like doing it. Example, _"I just can't get my self to work on this or, just can't get out of bed early."_

This usually happened to my side projects, stuff that I personally want to work on, other than my day job. These were the projects that interested me to work on.

### Solution

- You need to stick to your routine. _"No matter how, I will put at least x hours a day."_


> “Inspiration is for amateurs.  The rest of us just show up and get to work.”

### When to use this

- Everyday, literally. This actually builds your grit.




## Reason 3

You are putting something off because it’s hard, boring, or otherwise unpleasant.


### Solution

- Use **If-then** planning.
- Embrace the fact that your willpower is limited, instead of relying on it, that says _"I will do it next time, 100%."_ (you would have already done it).
- Making an if-then plan is more than just deciding what specific steps you need to take to complete a project – it’s also deciding where and when you will take them.

_"If it is 2pm, then I will stop what I’m doing and start work on the report Bob asked for."_

_"If my boss doesn’t mention my request for a raise at our meeting, then I will bring it up again before the meeting ends."_


## General tips

- Always focus on being better, rather than being good.
