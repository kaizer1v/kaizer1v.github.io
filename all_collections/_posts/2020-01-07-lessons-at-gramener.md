Here are the lessons I learnt during my 2 years at Gramener, working as a Technical Lead on various projects.


## 1/ Everything Can Be Scoped

Never fear the time-crunch and effort needed to avoid deadlines. Always focus on MVP.


## 2/ Do First, Improve Later

MVP isn't always ideal. Thus, it's a minimal product. It doesn't need to have the best, high-quality code. It should, and should only **communicate progress**


## 3/ Leaders Know How To Delegate Better

Never take the burden of doing everything yourself. Divide equally & race against time equally among your team. It takes people management skills as well as time management skills.


## 4/ Time The Goals

A goal in itself isn't really useful, unless you know how much time it needs to be done in.


## 5/ Fail Fast - Fail Often

If a day hasn't helped you move ahead towards the goal, act on it - FAST. Park it but don't ignore it. Least you can do is ask for help.


## 6/ Progress Should ALWAYS Be Visible

In any way possible, I should always be moving ahead - one step at a time, but never stopping. Also, always communicate the progress too. These are key things when scaling really fast
