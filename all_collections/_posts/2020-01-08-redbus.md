# Increasing RedBus's App Engagement

Here's some great retention & engagement strategies for RedBus and how they could use to retain their customers and increase engagement on their mobile app.

This is what the flow of booking on the redbus website / app looks like

1. Enter destination
2. Select date of travel / return journey date
3. Search and filter for convenient bus by
  - Pickup location (stop name)
  - Drop-off location (stop name)
  - and other amenities etc.
4. Enter passenger details
5. Make payment
6. Receive notification / email

Now, after this point, I really don't use the RedBus app - everything I do is off the app from here like

1. Viewing the ticket
2. Setting myself a reminder for leaving to the bus stop
3. Call the bus driver to know where they are & whether it's the bus or a pick-up van
4. Show printed ticket / email / sms to the conductor before boarding the bus

But here are some great ways RedBus could keep users engaged even after the booking is completed

## Commute Experience

There are several things that happen once you are travelling on the bus

1. "Are we stopping for dinner somewhere?"
2. Language issues with the conductor / driver
3. Where exactly do I need to get off?
4. How will I go after being dropped off?

Here are some ideas to increase user engagement post booking experience



### Idea 1 - Pre-order food

Allow me to see the bus's route so that I know where and when the bus would be stopping. If it's stopping at a restaurant - allow me to pre-order to decrease halt time. Heck, even IRCTC allows me to book meals from the train.



### Idea 2 - Commute experience

There's always that movie no one wants to watch but it's still playing in that huge tv with loud speakers - damn irritating. Here's what RedBus should do - provide me some streaming options for movies, music or games, even if it's for a price



### Idea 3 - Notify before drop

No one likes asking the conductor again and again where we are and how long will it take to reach the destination. A great hack to it is, using google maps live location. But why not integrate that with RedBus's app to notify 10 mins before reaching the destination?
