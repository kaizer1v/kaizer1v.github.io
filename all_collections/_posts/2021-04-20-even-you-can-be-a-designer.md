# What is Design Thinking?

If you are pondering about to this question, look no further. There are a lot of methods out there that explain what design thinking is. Many like the Double Diamond, Standford.d, [Ideo's set of design thinking tools](https://designthinking.ideo.com/) and many more, but if you were to start thinking about

_what are the commonalities among these processes?_ and _what are the underlying principles that design thinking is trying to answer?_, then you might end up with the below 4 broad questions. This is how I thought of design thinking

1. **Who** are you building for? (becomes your persona)
2. **What** are you trying to build for them? (becomes your product)
3. **Why** are you building it? (becomes your goal)
4. **How** should I build it? (becomes your strategy)

If you can answer the above 4 questions, you would have applied 90% of design-thinking process. The remaining 10% is just based on the tools you use to arrive there.

## 1. Who

There are multiple ways to figure out *who* you are trying to build for. Obviously you'll start with existing user research already done. Chances are the user you are targetting is already been targetted by someone else, so use that.

But if you want to DIY then you can feel free to use the existing tools from the internet. Some of them are

1. Surveys & Interviews
2. Contextual Inquiries (Give someone a problem with some tools & ask them to solve it - you need to observe)


## 2. What

To figure this out, you'll have to already complete the first step, because, you'll need someone to validate the idea against & that someone needs to be as close to your end-user. To figure out what they want to use, you can approach them with something that already exists. You don't need to build something to give it to them. You can combine a bunch of existing tools to ask them how they would use these combinations. Some other ways to test "what" they want is by giving something that might look at the end-product, but not really the end product i.e. a prototype or sorts. The prototype is really important because one of these prototypes will improve into the end product.

Some of the tools that you can use to prototype are

1. Pen & Paper rough drawings
2. Wireframes (Balsamiq, Figma or Sketch) -> but black & white


## 3. Why

The most important piece of information you'll get by answering this question is the "Why" are you building something for them. In order to get to that, you'll have to have done the 1st 2 steps. When you perform the 2nd step multiple times - you'll understand and discover what the user is really trying to do - that's when you'll figure out what they really "NEED", it might be something that they "WANT".

Analysing is important when you do the back-and-forth process in the 2nd step of trying to figure out the "what". Often the "What" & the "Why" is being answered simultaneously


## 4. How

Once you have figured out "why" they need "what" they need, you'll start strategising on how to achieve that. For the most part, you would have already done in the "what" phase by providing multiple fidelities of prototypes. The aim of the "how" question is to concretise on to an MVP (minimal viable product) and how you'll make that MVP reach your end users (aka marketing).

By answering these 4 questions you would have applied design thinking for the most part. This isn't a concrete one-way stepped process or a checklist that you follow and you'll get there. This helps you **think** in a certain way, like a guideline or a method or an underlying principle on whatever you do on top of it. This isn't a tool. When you think about solving a problem using these questions, you are free to choose the tools or methods that you want to when trying to answer each of them. I have personally used these questioning-method to try and solve for user problems - and it has worked. It has made me from "thinking-like-a-developer" to "thiking-like-a-problem-solver"
