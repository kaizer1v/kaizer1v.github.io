As part of learning design, I tried to re-design the card checkout flow on mobile apps.

Here's what the flow looks like

<figure class="row justify-content-center figure text-center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/card_checkout_user_flow.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Screenshot 1.1">
</figure>

Based on this userflow, I created some wireframes trying to generate UI ideas by looking at some alternatives for how the user would interact with the app.

<figure class="row justify-content-center figure text-center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/card_checkout_screens_01.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Screenshot 1.1">
</figure>

<figure class="row justify-content-center figure text-center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/card_checkout_screens_02.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Screenshot 1.1">
</figure>

After exploring these alternatives, this is what the high fidelity prototype looks like.

<figure class="row justify-content-center figure text-center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/card_checkout_design.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Screenshot 1.1">
</figure>
