*A personal project to redesign the Bangalore aquarium experience.*

### Scenario & Challenges

So, I went to this Government Aquarium in Bangalore right next to Cubbon Park. About 10 years back, this aquarium was one of the tourist places to visit in Bangalore. I had visited here as a kid. But Bangalore has grown, populated ever since, but not in terms of the experience of the aquarium, for sure.
Also, after talking to a few officials, they pointed that the numbers have gradually decreased over the period of 5 - 6 years, after youtube and tv channels. It was also noted that this could have happened becuase of the low maintenance and less priority and budget to uplift experience of the establishment. 

How could we improve the aquarium experience ?


### Problem Statement

How to improve the visitor's or tourist's aquarium experience to make more memorable in order to increase numbers of visitors and sales.


### Research

We looked at some of the existing aquariums across the globe providing the best learning experience. We also identified the kinds of people who walk into an aquarium, during what time of the day and which days of the week. Here are some of the findings that we noted down

#### Visitor Profiles (User Personas)

* Children group - parents / friends / school teacher
* Teenagers group (11 - 20) - parents / friends / school teacher
* Families
* Mid 20s - couples / friends
* Tourists / enthusiasts

Time-wise distribution of visitors during the different days of the week

#### HMW (How Might We)

After doing a brainstorming session with the team, we came up with some interesting ideas on how might we, including a series of areas to focus on **in order to improve the experience of the aquarium** as well as increase the brand of the aquarium as a whole. Here are a list of some of the top prioritised focus areas.

**POV**: Improve the experience of the aquarium

* HMW - increase the sales of tickets at the aquarium
* HMW - make visitor's experience more engaging and memorable
* HMW - encourage parents and teachers to take children to the aquarium
* HMW - improve the state of the fish tanks
* HMW - provide an emmersive experience to the visitors
* HMW - make the aquarium discoverable and engage community

#### Online Reviews

We also looked at what visitors / customers talked about the experience online like on platforms such as [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297628-d3913104-Reviews-Bangalore_Aquarium-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html) - which has an average rating of 3 out of 5, with 76 reviews. The summary of the reviews highlights

* "A very average experience"
* "Compact and value for money"
* "People with disabilities can't access the aquarium"
* "If you don't have any option to spend time, then go there - it's ok for kids"
* "The variety of species is very limited to common fishes, found at a fish shop"
* "Very difficult for senior citizens"
* "The state of the fish tank in which the fishes are kept feels like they are prisoned"

Here are some of the facts based on wikipedia

- It is the 2nd largest aquarium in Asia
- Opened in 1983 - open for 32 years as of 2015
- It is administered by the state government

#### Comparative Analysis

I also performed some comparative analysis with the best aquarium in the world, looking at some of the features that make the experience so great. Here are a few of them

##### [Sealife Berlin](https://www.visitsealife.com/en/berlin/)

- It has it's own website
- Online booking facility, mobile friendly ticket & discounts
- Basic information like timings, how to get there, closest public transport
- Promotion video showcasing best features and facilities
- Things like - top 5 creatures
- Feeding times
- Aquarium map
- They also had themed based fishes like, fishes found in the **rocky shores**, or **ocean fishes** or fishes only found in the **deep sea** etc.
- Movie screening / documentary in the aquarium
- Social media presence, youtube channel, facebook page, instagram. (_last video uploaded 3 years ago_)
- Personal experience of feeding the fishes, handling the fishes etc.
- Underwater tunnels (dome shaped paths)
- The quality and variety of species itself


##### [Shanghai Ocean Aquarium](http://www.sh-aquarium.com/en/html/index.aspx)

- Dedicated website
- Info about the fishes on their website
- Social media - quick snippets about the visitor's/tourist's experience
- An event based blog on upcoming or past events, highlights of the month etc.
- Educational tours


### Ideas

After collecting researching on the kinds of visitors, online reviews and other aquariums across the globe, we identified some of the key pain points that we wanted to address in the HMW section. We shortlisted a few key problem areas and brainstormed on how we might be able to tackle these challenges.

I have listed down the ideas based on the **HMW** discribed above

**HMW - Increase the sales of the tickets?**

We had an indirect solution in order to solve this problem, but we mentioned a few of these here.

- Have more tickets sold by marketing them 
- Providing them offers and partnering with Vishweshwariya Musuem and other tourist locations
- Making the tickets cheaper

**HMW - Encourage parents and teachers to bring their children**

In this case the target audience were the teachers and parents directly. So, we thought of reaching out to them like

- Market at schools (esp biology departments)
- Reaching out to colleges present in Bangalore at Zoology department / marine studies (if present)
- Conducting workshops related to student's curriculum (biology/zoology subjects)
- 

**HMW - Improve the state of the fish tanks** 

- Collect stones from beaches and give them to aquarium
- Have corals in the tanks
- Have various species and exotic fishes (large and small i.e. Sharks, Octupus etc.)
- 

**HMW - Provide an emmersive experience to the visitors**

- Having quiz at the end of the aquarium for kids
- Having a VR experience titled "Into the ocean"
- Have a documentary screening in the aquarium
- Have feeding time for fishes
- Have a tour guide explaining the fishes


### Disecting the Ideas

We did a small exercise choosing a couple of ideas, by asking _"What's stopping us"_ and _"Why?"_ to the ideas.

We finally chose two ideas from the above list

### The Ideal Experience

Adults and chidren visit aquarium to see and learn about the wild, bizarre and wonderful aquatic species that you may never see in your daily life (unless you are a mermaid, in which case, you have no reason to visit the aquarium. Anyway...). Children enjoy seeing these species and get awed. They not only learn about them, but also experience the joy of watching them, so that they can remember or simply get fascinated by watching them. That is how the aquarium experience should be. I simply visited because I was wanting to do something kiddish and also wanted to see the fishes, their colours, wierd defence mechanisms and funny mouths. But, here is what happens.

> Side Note: By writing this article, I am also proposing ways to improve the aquarium experience and tips for the government to make improvements and development.


## The Solution

### Location

The location of the aquarium is quite good and easy for tourists. It lies in the heart of Bangalore, next to Cubbon Park and Visvesvaraya Industrial Museum. According to the wiki page, there are about 1 million visitors at the Museum. Building the aquarium should attract equal number of people as it stands about 100 meters from the entry gate of the museum. This aquarium was established in 1983 and apparently has an exotic cultivable as well as ornamental fish on display. 

### Architecture

The shape of the building is somewhat conical. It looks like this.

![Bangalore Aquarium](http://admirableindia.com/wp-content/images/karnataka/DSCN0807.jpg)

The ground floor is a converted government maintainence office, the 1st and the 2nd floor (*shown as escalated ramp in image.*) are aquipped with about 70 fish tanks for visitors to view. The entry fee to view this is only 5 INR. The shape of the building being round makes it convenient for people to view all the fish tanks allowing them to move in a circle. But, at the same time as the crowd increases, the space (diameter) is not enough to hold a lot of people. At a time a single floor can accommodate about 60 - 70 audience.

The architecture should allow about 100 people to easily move around within the floor. Ideally, the time taken for a single person on a single floor is about 20 - 30 minutes on average. 20 - 30 minutes for a normal human being, majority of which are/could be children, the aquarium could be improved a lot more by having some interactive, fun information points for kids and students. This will help them learn more about the aquatic life. Simply put, they could start with the evolution of aquatic life and proceed with the evolution and sorting them accordingly and ending with a large dome sized room with glass finish so that one can see all the fishes around (like the one in Singapore).

The inside architecture looks somewhat like this.

### Single Fish Tank

Coming to the most important part of the experience - the fish tank. A single fish tank should have appropriate content and information that is relavent for the viewer / audience. The fish tank had content like

- Name
- Scientific Name / Binomial Name
- Region Found
- Feeds on

From these, some are quite important information, such as name, region found and feeds on. But it could have been put in a differnt way, non-important information like *feeds on* is a non-important information but a necessary one.

### Proposal

A user should be able to retrieve required information whenever required and should be at his disposal. In order to make this possible, contextually, we combined a few existing technologies and created a prototype of enabling a user to retrieve more and interactive information about a particular fish/artifact.

Using the QR code technology, we were able to get information about a given artifact, just like a bar code present on a product stores information like it's price, name etc. The QR code can contain digital media or articles about a particular fish the viewer is viewing. He can then use his smart phone to scan a QR code present near the fish tank and retrieve more information on it.

This enhances the viewer's experience since they would be interacting with the system to retrieve information which inturns connects them to the system. They will be able to share and save the information they are interested in for later reference. This would especially be helpul for viewers who are children or school students.
