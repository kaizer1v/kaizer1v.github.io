  A few trends of note: 54% of the worldâ€™s population live in urban communities, the average marriage age for men is 29 (up from 26 two decades ago) and for women is 27 (up from 23 in the same time period). Given these trends, city dwellers tend to spend most of their twenties living with flatmates. Finding and keeping a good flatmate, however, gets harder as more people swarm into a city like Bangalore.

  ## Approach

  The aim of the research was to understand from people looking for flat or even flatmates, about their goals, pain points and motivations.

  After conducting [several interviews](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cDkqIJx-6OvONEgfM_Bqmm8_HYWxrbBH) and gathering their responses, we were able to understand the nature of challenges they were facing on the existing platforms. It was surprising to learn that everyone relied mostly on one single way to find either a flatmate or an apartment - using facebook groups called "Flat & Flatmates".

  We were able to build personas to understand the specific needs of the kind of users we were trying to solve this problem for.

  Here's how our hypotheses were questioned when talking to actual users.

  * Majority of the users wanted to share a flat with one other person. None of the users wanted to share a flat with more than 5 people
  * Female's first preference when looking for a flat, is to have an attached bathroom
  * People tend to live as close to their workplace as possible - reducing commute time i.e. within 5 km radius
  * None of them wanted to pay brokerage to find an apartment, since broker's weren't trust worthy
  * When searching for a flatmate, only about 40% people were indifferent about the other's diet preferences like non-vegetarian / vegetarian

  Here's what the journey of Shreya, a user searching for a flat within 5 km from her office - looks like

  Now let's see how the journey of a user searching for a flatmate looks like

  Taking the facebook interactions and the sheer volume of posts and comments on the group into account, I was able re-look at how I could improve the experience of searching for flatmates as well as flats at the same time. Here are some initial sketches of what the platform would look like on the mobile.

  _Why mobile first?_
  
  Here's [a report published by Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/377808/distribution-of-facebook-users-by-device/) showing the usage of facebook on web vs mobile of users worldwide.

  After iterating through some alternative ways for searching & filtering, I narrowed down on the interactions and went ahead to build a visual design version of the application.
