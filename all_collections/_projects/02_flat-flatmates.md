  A few trends of note: 54% of the worldâ€™s population live in urban communities, the average marriage age for men is 29 (up from 26 two decades ago) and for women is 27 (up from 23 in the same time period). Given these trends, city dwellers tend to spend most of their twenties living with flatmates. Finding and keeping a good flatmate, however, gets harder as more people swarm into a city like Bangalore.

  ## Approach

  Conducted research to understand user's goals, pain points and motivations seeking for flat or flatmates.

  We decided to conduct [interviews](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cDkqIJx-6OvONEgfM_Bqmm8_HYWxrbBH) in order to gather qualitative inputs about challenges they faced when searching for flats & flatmates and pain points addressed towards using existing platforms like Facebook groups, 99Acres and housing.com.

  Based on the inputs gathered, we built two personas

  <figure class="row justify-content-center figure text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/projects/user_persona_02.jpg" class="border figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Persona">
  </figure>

  ### Learnings from Interviews

  * Majority of the users wanted to share a flat with one other person. None of the users wanted to share a flat with more than 5 people
  * Female's first preference when looking for a flat, is to have an attached bathroom
  * People tend to live as close to their workplace as possible - reducing commute time i.e. within 5 km radius
  * None of them wanted to pay brokerage to find an apartment, since broker's weren't trust worthy
  * When searching for a flatmate, only about 40% people were indifferent about the other's diet preferences like non-vegetarian / vegetarian

  ### User Journey

  We looked into the steps involved for searching for a flat

  Here's what the journey of Shreya, a user searching for a flat within 5 km from her office - looks like

  Now let's see how the journey of a user searching for a flatmate looks like

  ### Solution

  We decided to focus on improving the search experience for Facebook groups. Here are some of the main pain points addressed in the solution

  **Posting an ad / requirement**

  * The posts being added isn't structured
  * The interface for adding a post, doesn't ensure necessary details to be added
  * The posts being added isn't categorised

  **Searching an ad / requirement**

  * The interface doesn't allow to categorically search
  * It's difficult to filter and search based on criteria like location, flat-type, male/female etc.
  * The interface doesn't allow to short-list or reject ads / posts

  **Wireframes**

  Here are some of the ideas we iterated upon to solve the above pain points.
