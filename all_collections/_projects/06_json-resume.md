  You must be using Google Docs or MS Word to create resumes, even I used to. Until I realised that it's very pain staking to make edits to layouts. Also, if you have ever asked for feedback from others before applying for jobs, you'll might have been told that 

  > _"It's good, but should talk more about the impact you made during..."_
  
  or

  > _"You should add a bio first and change the format to make it more readable..."_

  and so on.

  JSON-Resume helps you use description templates and the format you should write your experiences in, best suitable for the position you are applying for.

  Lo and behold - introducing the [JSON-Resume](https://github.com/kaizer1v/json-resume). It allows you to pick the relevant experiences based on the position you apply for and lets you pick the best format & download your resume.

  ## Approach

  Instead of directly choosing a format for your resume and then filling in the details to fit in one page - JSON-Resume first takes all the projects and work experiences you have over the years.

  Then, using a web interface, you can pick the most relevant projects and experience to showcase for the position you are applying for.

  This helps you have your content separate from your layout and choose any layout you want to. Heck, you can even build your own layout using just HTML/CSS or even Bootstrap like frameworks and add it to the library for everyone else to use.

  If you like the idea, would love you to contribute to this project any time on the [github repository](https://github.com/kaizer1v/json-resume). Currently it's a work in progress. Do contribute.
