intro: |
  As part of the design team at Informatica, we wanted to introduce rapid prototyping as a practice to build and test interfaces with our customers, first hand. For the team, having a skilled programmer in the team added the benefit of being able to build these prototypes in a much more interactive way.

  In order to do this, I conducted a very basic research by interviewing some of the UI developers and how they build the interface for the enterprise products. It turned out that they used a front end library of components equipped with 

  * Interactions and animations as well as it's own CSS for visual design.
  * This was a library written in Java programming language and required a lot of setting up in order to be used.
  * The component library also had many dependencies which was a challenge to get hold of, especially for a prototype.
  * Time consuming communications between developer and a designer

  Current prototyping tests were being conducted as the following

  Thus, came the light weight component library for building rapid prototypes.
