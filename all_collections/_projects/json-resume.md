challenge: To build a easily customisable resume maker and empower HTML/CSS capabilities in your resume.

content_body: |

  You must be using Google Docs or MS Word to create resumes, even I used to. Until I realised that it's very pain staking to make edits to layouts. Usually the only way to make layouts on these tools I mentioned are by using tables and it's very hard to edit once the layout is set.

  Lo and behold - introducing the [JSON-Resume](https://github.com/kaizer1v/json-resume).

  You can have your content separate from your layout and choose any layout you want to. Heck, you can even build your own layout using just HTML/CSS or even Bootstrap like frameworks.

  Yes, it's a work in progress. I am currently working on the interface that will allow the user to drag & drop sections of the resume to create a layout - do wait and watch this space.

  If you like the idea, would love you to contribute to this project any time on the [github repository](https://github.com/kaizer1v/json-resume) - as always it's a work in progress. Do contribute.
