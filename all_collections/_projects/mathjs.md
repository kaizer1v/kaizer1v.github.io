challenge: To build a collage of common operations for mathematical purposes that can easily be used and extended.

content_body: |

  When building visualisations using D3js, I always found myself writing many custom mathematical functions for common operations like intersection of two arrays or finding elements that are in one array but not in the other.

  I also at the same time, wanted to learn to write a javascript library of myself. I decided to write this library by myself for this very puspose.

  I published it on npm and to my surprise, even today, it has on [average 7 downloads a week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplemathjs).

  You can also see the [documentation page here](https://github.com/kaizer1v/mathjs).

  Yes, there were many libraries out there like [underscorejs](https://underscorejs.org/) and even another called [mathjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjs), which has a lot more complex operations like matrices and symbolic computation. But these weren't light weight and had many other dependencies on them.

  But I must admit that there was quite a satisfaction on publishing and writing my own library was fun - so why not & yes I learned a lot too.

  If you like the idea, would love you to contribute to this project any time on the [github repository](https://github.com/kaizer1v/mathjs) - as always it's a work in progress. Do contribute.
