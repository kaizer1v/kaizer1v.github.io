challenge: To reduce effort and time of writing repeated calculation based functions.

content_body: |

  When building visualisations for projects at Gramener, I always found myself writing many custom mathematical functions for common operations like intersection of two arrays or finding the difference between two arrays and many more quite repeatedly.

  ## Approach

  At first, I created a library of functions written by developers - specifically for doing mathematical operations. I then created a [github-gist](https://gist.github.com/kaizer1v), where anyone could copy paste the function they wanted to use.

  This became difficult to search and the information wasn't well organised. It wasn't efficient in terms of encapsulating the details - which wasn't really required.

  I decided to write a library that would completely hide the details of the function itself and anyone could simply invoke their math function like `MJ.factors(123)`, making it a one line code of use and provided a documentation of all the functions available.

  ## Result

  Significantly improved development speed for JS developers. It was actively used on developing projects at Gramener. Published it on [npm for open use](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplemathjs) as well which got an average 7 downloads weekly.

  You can also see the [documentation here](https://github.com/kaizer1v/mathjs).

  ### Note

  Yes, there were many libraries out there like [underscorejs](https://underscorejs.org/) and even another called [mathjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjs), which has a lot more complex operations like matrices and symbolic computation. But these weren't light weight and had many other dependencies on them.

  But I must admit that there was quite a satisfaction on publishing and writing my own library was fun - so why not & yes I learned a lot too.

  If you like the idea, would love you to contribute to this project any time on the [github repository](https://github.com/kaizer1v/mathjs) - as always it's a work in progress. Do contribute.
