challenge: To device a solution to increase speed in prototyping & testing features on products across Informatica.

result: A light weight component library with plug-and-play like elements. These elements could be copy-pasted in your HTML to build your interface.

role: |
  * Design and build a design system
  * Product prototyping
  * Conduct user validation & feedback and update the design
  * Build prototyping process within the design team

  As part of the design team at Informatica, we wanted to introduce rapid prototyping as a practice to build and test interfaces with our customers, first hand, without depending on the engineering team.

  ## The Approach

  Conducted basic research by talking to UI developers and observe the process used to build interfaces for products.

  **Insights**

  * Design team had to depend on UI developers for prototyping
  * UI developers used in-house framework, that couldn't work without back-end dependencies (Java, Servlets etc.) and data
  * A visual design language was required and tested on interfaces
  * Time consuming communications between developer and a designer

  ## The Solution

  A <a href="https://kaizer1v.github.io/infa-components" target="_blank">light weight design system</a> which enabled to build and iterate over prototypes faster and aligned to the visual-design language and specifications.

  ## Impact

  * Prototypes were built 2x times faster
  * Integrated within designer's workflow using Axure, enabling copy-paste of UI elements for designers across all teams
  * Eliminated dependencies on UI/Software Engineers
  * 10x lighter and no dependencies
  * Customisable by simply editing Javascript / HTML / CSS
  * Successfully implemented and tested prototypes building 50+ features across enterprise cloud products like [Data profiling](https://kaizer1v.github.io/profiling/) & [here](https://kaizer1v.github.io/profiling/page2.html?srNo=2)


  _Yes, the designers had to have little bit of HTML / CSS knowledge for customising the UI_

  **Components**

  The light weight library took into consideration the following

  1. Visual Design Elements - The typography, colours and icons as well as layouts
  2. Components & Atoms - Components consisted of elements which were re-used or sometimes even combined together to form more complex components. These ranged from simple input boxes to trees and accordians
  3. Language - The flow of interactions as well as the language used within the products
  4. Interactions - The interactions at multiple levels among simple and complex components

  **Usage**

  You can view the actual demo <a href="https://kaizer1v.github.io/profiling/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://kaizer1v.github.io/profiling/page2.html" target="_blank">here</a> respectively.

  Using the design system we were successfully able to iterate through building prptotypes at 2x speed and tested them with end users, who didn't even realise they were interacting with a prototype instead of an actual end product.
