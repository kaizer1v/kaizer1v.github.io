## Duration

Two Weeks

## Role

User Researcher

## Team

* Vivek Shrinivasan
* Rasagya Sharma
* CivicDataLab Team

## Result

A mockup for a platform that allows a researcher to access, analyse and understand judiciary data across courts in India

**Background**

The main concern about the judiciary system in India is the amount of pending cases in courts is enormous. On the other hand, based on the RTI act, the government makes the data across all courts openly accessible, but making it an impeding task for the public.

**Research**

The research phase started by trying to understand how are researchers, within the judiciary sector consuming the data. Talking to NLU researchers, civil society organisations within the judiciary sector and looking at other initiatives, we understood that the primary pain point for researchers is the ease of access to relevant data which could be analysed.

Following an indepth understanding of the usage and consumption of such data and based on the the motivations and goals of researchers, we were able to understand how, currently were users gathering, synthesising this data. CivicDataLab partnered with Ashoka foundation to, who helped us conduct the interviews and give access to connections within the sector to help solve this challenge.
