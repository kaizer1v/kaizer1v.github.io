  [The document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QzhzttZLH3ERhrNm-SSyfF62ak_akNWV4UtfOhdyC-c/edit?usp=sharing) collates the research I have performed over the course of two weeks, in order to come up with a design proposition and direction for the Open Judiciary Data Platform (OJDP). OJDP is a conceptual platform which aims to ease access and analysis to Indiaâ€™s judiciary data across district and high courts.

  ## Impact

  It helped reduce significant time & effort of downloading and querying the data to find relevant information. The interface also enables to select partial / selected rows to be downloaded, reducing bandwidth and space. The data platform makes searching and filtering remarkably easier.

  ## Research

  The research phase started by trying to understand how are researchers, within the judiciary sector, are consuming the data. Talking to NLU researchers, and professors, civil society organisations within the judiciary sector and looking at other initiatives within India as well as in other countries, I was able to understand that there is a **lack of ease of access to** relevant data which could be analysed.

  Following an indepth understanding of the usage and consumption of such data and based on the the motivations and goals of researchers, I was able to understand how, currently were users gathering, synthesising this data. CivicDataLab partnered with Ashoka foundation to, who helped us conduct the interviews and give access to connections within the sector to help solve this challenge.
