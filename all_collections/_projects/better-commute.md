  ## Needfinding

  The research started off trying to understand the current problems and challenges people face on their everyday commute. This was done by talking and interviewing candidates and how they described their goals and challenges.

  _You can listen to one of the interviews recorded below_

  Following an in depth understanding of their mode, time and location of commute. The interviewing mainly focused on discovering their pain points, overall motivations and goals as well as knowing what they found joyful in their experience of commuting.

  The three main ideas that emerged out of the interviewing were

  * A social way to a hassle free commute based on commuter comments
  * Motivating & encouraging people to use environmentally friendly transport
  * Safety in the cycling experience

  Storyboards were built to address these issues.

  Shifting the focus only on car commuters and figuring a social way to a hassle free commute, these were some of the wireframes designed to understand the challenges better.

  New ideas emerged from brainstorming like

  * HMW be able to figure out availibility of parking
  * HMW be able to know if the road quality is good, with less pot holes
  * HMW be able to rank a route by it's safety (ample street light, police presence etc)

  Here's an example of what the current user flow for parking in a city like Bangalore looks like.

  > “Even If I am willing to pay a fee, there is hardly any parking space.”
