                  Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? What do they got in there? King Kong? Just my luck, no ice. I was part of something special. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

                  You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Yes, Yes, without the oops! We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
                  
                  Did he just throw my cat out of the window? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Must go faster. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Must go faster. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.
                  
                  Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Must go faster. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Checkmate... Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. What do they got in there? King Kong?
                  
                  Checkmate... Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.
                  
                  Must go faster. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.
                  
                  What do they got in there? King Kong? I was part of something special. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose.

                  Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.
                  
                  Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Life finds a way. Just my luck, no ice. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Yes, Yes, without the oops! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck.
