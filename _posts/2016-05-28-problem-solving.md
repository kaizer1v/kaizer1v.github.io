*Problem Solving.*

-----

In life, a systematic and analytical approach to problem solving is key which will help you succeed and overcome failures, may it be in professional or even your social life. The first most important thing to sovle a problem is - well - accept that there is a problem and confront it, whether it be your peers or your better half. Once you have identified there is a problem, try to find the root cause instead of hastily reacting based on symtoms of the problems. But before you solve the problem, you must clearliy articulate what the problem is and how is it affecting you/your organization. To begin, 

### UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
- Review the information you already have about the problem like, what might be causing the problem and how impactful the problem is
- Break it down to one single problem if possible which opens up a clear path to approach the problem
- Finally, determine the root cause of the problem by diagonising the problem thoroughly considering all possibilities (5 why technique)

### FRAME THE PROBLEM STATEMENT
Translating the problem into a definite question helps understanding the problem better. Ensure to make the question SMART which means
the problem is:

1. **S**pecific: a clearly defined goal
2. **M**easurable - a metric against which you will judge your actions that helps you track progress
3. **A**chievable - based on the time and resources at your disposal
4. **R**elevant - which aligns to your greater goals
5. **T**ime Bound - that contains a time frame which will help you plan your actions

### IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL CAUSES
Once the key problem has been framed as a question, you can brainstorm the potential causes. You can branch out possible causes and organize them in a tool called as an 'Issue Tree'. You can break down every problem until your desired level of specificity so as to make them manageable and independent enough to be solved parallelly, if possible.

### PRIORITIZING FIXING THE CAUSES
Remember, problem solving is not about addressing all the factors influencing the problem, it is about effectively prioritizing issues and solutions that move the needle. Use the effort vs impact graph to plot your causes to assign them priorities. Once you do that, start tackling problems which take minimum effort but have maximum impact (80/20 rule).

### HYPOTHESIZE A SOLUTION AND PLAN
Pick up the key factor of your top priority issue you pointed using the previous step. Consider a hypothesis to a issue i.e. what you believe to be a solution to that issue. Once you have a hypothesis stating 'why' you think this particular hypothesis will resolve the issue, you will have a set of factors to analyze your actual solution (which you will implement later) against. This will be the data that will help you prove your hypothesis and present using data. The hypothesis will also help you plan the time and resource you need to put in order to fix this issue.

### ANALYZE
While your work on the issue, keep track of the factors you have considered to analyze your solutions against. This is what will build up the data for your analysis. 

### SYNTHESIZE
Interpreting conclusions based your analysis should be the next step. You would have drawn large amount of conclusions based on your analysis. This step helps you consolidate only the important and meaningful analysis for your future referral. By asking yourself 'So What? Why does this matter?', 'Does this refute the hypothesis I was testing?', you can create critical outputs from your analysis.

### COMMUNICATE
Story tell what you have analyzed and concluded in the best way as you can. Ultimately, the credibility of your solution and the impact of your work largely depend on your ability to effectively structure and deliver this message. Make your recommendation actionable and it must address what actions are required and how it will work. Communicate the logic and justify why you made such crucial decisions, this will top it off.
