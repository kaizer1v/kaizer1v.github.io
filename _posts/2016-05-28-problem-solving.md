*Problem Solving.*

-----

In life, a systematic and analytical approach to problem solving is key which will help you succeed and overcome failures, may it be in professional or even your social life. A systematic approach to problem solving will help you to consistently identify the root of problems and to solve them in an **efficient**, **consistent**, and **credible** way. In order to sovle a problem is - well - first, accept that there is a problem and confront it, whether it be your peers or your better half. Once you have identified there is a problem, try to find the **root cause** instead of hastily reacting based on symtoms of the problems. A large part of successful problem solving also depend on the solverâ€™s ability to hone in on the _root cause of the issue_, _identify and draw insights from the right pieces_ of information, and _synthesize findings_ for a solution.

The next steps involve the process of solving the problem. These setps are sequenced in 7 broad steps needed to solve a problem. McKinsey, a global leadning consulting firm pioneered the most widely used problem solving framework, as described in '[The McKinsey Way](http://www.logro.sk/na_stiahnutie/the_mckinsey_way.pdf)'.:

### IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM
Saperate the root cause of the problem from its symptoms. Clearly articulate the key question you are trying to solve.
- Review the information you already have about the problem like, what might be causing the problem and how impactful the problem is
- Break it down to one single problem if possible which opens up a clear path to approach the problem
- Finally, determine the root cause of the problem by diagonising the problem thoroughly considering all possibilities (5 why technique)

### FRAME THE PROBLEM STATEMENT
Translating the problem into a definite question helps understanding the problem better. Ensure to make the question SMART which means
the problem is:

1. **S**pecific: a clearly defined goal
2. **M**easurable - a metric against which you will judge your actions that helps you track progress
3. **A**chievable - based on the time and resources at your disposal
4. **R**elevant - which aligns to your greater goals & eliminate unnecessary goals
5. **T**ime Bound - that contains a time frame which will help you plan your actions
A good example might be:

**Context**: Caroline is experiencing delivery delays because she is not paying vendors on time. You have isolated that the root cause of the issue stems from her accounts payable process.

**Problem Statement**: "How can I ensure all supply vendors are paid within 30 days over the next two months?"

OR

**Context**: You are a freelance designer and operate lean. You are struggling to bring in business.

**Problem Statement**: "How can I increase my freelance revenues by 25% within the next two months?"

### STRUCTURE THE PROBLEM
Once the key problem has been framed as a question, you can brainstorm the potential causes. You can branch out possible causes and organize them in a tool called as an 'Issue Tree'. Considering the freelancer's problem statement (stated above), you could branch out by writing the 1st possibility as __the reason for my low revenues could be, I am not taking up enough projects__. See figure below. Next, potential solutions will flow from these. You can break down every problem until your desired level of specificity so as to make them manageable and independent enough to be solved parallelly, if possible.

### PRIORITIZING FIXING THE CAUSES
Remember, problem solving is not about addressing all the factors influencing the problem, it is about effectively prioritizing issues and solutions that move the needle. Use the effort vs impact graph to plot your causes to assign them priorities. Once you do that, start tackling problems which take minimum effort but have maximum impact (80/20 rule).

### MAKE A PLAN
Pick up the key factor of your top priority issue you pointed using the previous step. Consider a hypothesis to a issue i.e. what you believe to be a solution to that issue. Once you have a hypothesis stating 'why' you think this particular hypothesis will resolve the issue, you will have a set of factors to analyze your actual solution (which you will implement later) against. This will be the data that will help you prove your hypothesis and present using data. The hypothesis will also help you plan the time and resource you need to put in order to fix this issue.

### ANALYZE PLAN AGAINST REALITY
While your work on the issue, keep track of the factors you have considered to analyze your solutions against. This is what will build up the data for your analysis. Use data gathered from internal and external sources to answer key questions that help you solve the problem in a better way.

### SYNTHESIZE FINDINGS
Interpreting conclusions based your analysis should be the next step. You would have drawn large amount of conclusions based on your analysis. This step helps you consolidate only the important and meaningful analysis for your future referral. By asking yourself 'So What? Why does this matter?', 'Does this refute the hypothesis I was testing?', you can create critical outputs from your analysis. Make connections and expand your thinking to find the best possible solution.

### COMMUNICATE
Story tell what you have analyzed and concluded in the best way as you can. Ultimately, the credibility of your solution and the impact of your work largely depend on your ability to effectively structure and deliver this message. Make your recommendation actionable and it must address what actions are required and how it will work. Communicate the logic and justify why you made such crucial decisions, this will top it off.
