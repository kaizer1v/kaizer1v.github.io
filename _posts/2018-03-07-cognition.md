*How cognition affects design thinking.*

Interaction Design is defined as 

> Designing spaces for human communication and interaction

Interaction designers are to the field of design as architects are to the building industry.

**How?**

They are both concerned with ensuring people can move freely, safely and securely,
that the features necessary for everyday living are accessible, and that all of the
individual components provide a cohesive experience.

The Process of Interaction Design involves mainly 4 steps (*Rogers, Preece and Sharp (2011)*)

1. Establishing Requirements
2. Designing Alternatives
3. Prototyping
4. Evaluating

Cognition drives human behaviour. Thus, the role of the designer is to support the
nature and limitations of human cognition.

Q: **But what is cognition?**
A: the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought,
    experience and the senses. - *Google Dictionary*

Have a look at [this short and fun video](https://youtu.be/R-sVnmmw6WY) to make it
more clearer.

There cognition process involves 6 main processes which are mainly.

1. Attention
2. Memory
3. Langauge
4. Reasoning
5. Problem Solving
6. Decision Making

Let's look at each one of them in a little detail

## Attention

The process of selecting only the information which is important and ignoring the rest.
The two types of processes that enable attention are

- **Top down** - where you only attend to your environment in order to achieve your objective.
    For example: when you are searching for your keys, you know how your `keychain` looks
    like, because that is already in your memory. Thus, your attention will only be grabbed
    by that key, when you look at it - you will probably not notice the spider lurking around
    because - at that moment, your objective is very clear. Thus, as a designer, show the
    user what he needs to - so that he can find what he wants.
- **Bottom up** - where the environment has automatically stimulates it's attention to you.
    In this case, there is no objective as such, thus, something like a sound of a **blast**
    can sieze your attention. Very similar to the whatsapp *ping* sound from your mobile.
    It clearly grabs your attention unwantedly. As a designer, there are ways to grab
    a user's attention with his product.


## Memory

The cognition which is responsible for storing and retrieving information.
There are two types of memory
- **Short term** or Active working memory - which usually has a span
    of 5 to 9 items (based on [research](https://www.simplypsychology.org/peterson-peterson.html)),
    but by the process of chunking one can retain more information in the short term memory.
    The technique of remembering more is a process called as chunking. Where you divide
    the information into multiple parts, buckets or categories. For example: Phone
    numbers are logicially divided into parts which are mainly
    ```javascript
    <country_code> <region_code> <provider> <random_number>
    ```
    Thus, it is easier to rememeber a number when you write it like
    `+91-889-234-745` rather than writing it like `+91889234745`.

- **Long term** - is the memory which, by practising can retain more information which
    can be later retrieved by environmental or situational factors. Every piece of
    information when practiced or revised enough will fit into the long-term memory.
    Sometimes, these can be biases or wrong information as well. These long-term
    memories are retrieved based on situational environment conditions, some event
    that invokes that thought, or some thing that invokes a particular memory of
    a person. Thus, as a good designer, one should take advantage of this asset
    and allow him to invoke that memory when you see something. I am pretty
    sure people from the 90s would very much remember this from their long-term memory

    Thus, a good designer would probably show the user something which they are already
    familiar with, or something they have already seen before helping them to relate
    to your product better.


## Language

The cognition responsible for communicating through symbols, images, written
text or verbal form. In order to communicate better with the user, by using the
least un-familier terms, the designer must know the user prior. Thus, as a designer
it is important to understand the language one needs to communicate in. These can be verbal, visual (icons or symbols) or written (text, letters). For example,
the thought that is invoked when you see ![settings](https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/trycons/32/settings-48.png) - invokes the term **settings** or something
**mechanical** or under-the-hood. Thus, allowing to use that memory by conveying
that this icon, is related to *settings*. Rather than showing the user something 
like ![bad settings](https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/seo-and-optimization/80/Seo_and_optimization_icons-05-48.png)


## Reasoning

The cognitive processes enabling evaluation and generation of logical arguments,
verification of facts and the assimilation, accommodation and rejection of new information
on the basis of existing knowledge. There are two types of reasoning
- **Inductive Reasoning** uses prior experiences and knowledge to draw a conclusion,
    which not necessarily is true. For example: 
    ```javascript
    if A is greater than B
    and B is greater than C
    then - A must be greater than C
    ```
    In this case, you can say with certainty that `C` is going to be smaller than `A`. As a good designer, you can make a statement like: 
    `5 out of 100 people die, doing this activity`, but rather make a statement which is like
    `There is a 95% chance that you will survive doing this activity`. Since, both
    make the same sense, but the latter is much more positive and are likely to do the "activity" than not.


- **Deductive Reasoning** allows you to draw a conclusion based on the
    premises of an argument. For example, since the Sun has been rising from the East
    everyday, it is likely that it is going to rise again tomorrow as well. Thus, as a designer, you can use this process of reasoning to showcase something like: 



## Problem Solving

The ability to develop ideas, strategies and behaviours that help one achieve their
objectives. Problem solving mainly involves three main steps
- **Goal Directedness** behaviour is directed towards the objective or the goal you want to achieve. As a designer, if you are wanting the user to *explore* a data-set for example, then
direct him in an intuitive way in which he can achieve that. 
- **Sub-goal decomposition** - Break the problem down into multiple sub-problems so that
it's crystal clear to understand the overview. As a good designer, you wouldn't want to overload the user's cognition with extra work in order to help him achieve their objective.
- **Operator selection** - Again, as a good designer, when there are multiple paths or options that a user can choose, help the user decide to take the best path to solve
their problem, with no dead-ends.


## Decision Making

The difference between problem solving and decision making is that decision making
specifially involves in choosing the best possible, avialable option where as the
former only involves in generating the strategies. Decision making not necessarily
deals with maximising gains or outputs but sometimes deals with minimising loss.
