*An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind*

## D3's Efficiency

D3's most efficient feature is the way it renders the graph. It's actually smart. When you
have a graph already rendered on your page, and say you want to update the graph
with some changes or you want to add some new data points, d3 efficiently figures out
the elements which are the same between the old and the new data, and only changes
the elements which are required to be updated. It also smartly removes the one which
is not required anymore.

## Practical Example

### Existing
You have an array of numbers

```javascript
[15, 8, 4, 7, 13]
```

### Enter
and say you add 2 new elements to this array. Now your array becomes

```javascript
[15, 8, 4, 7, 13, 19]
```

You can notice that the elements **13** and **19** are added, but the other ones remain
intact. D3 identifies this and it automatically adds the two elements in the `enter` selection.
In this case the `exit` selection remains empty.

- `enter` will have `2` elements
- `exit` will remain `empty`

### Exit

Now, from the previous step, you remove 2 elements, so that your array looks like

```javascript
[4, 7, 13, 19]
```

In this case you removed the 1st two elements **15** and **8** from the previous array.
D3 now has 

- `enter` will remain `empty` since no new elements were added
- `exit` will have `2` elements i.e. **15** and **8**


### Update

Now, let's say you change the previously existing array, by which I mean, you keep
the length of the array the same i.e. `4` but change the values, so that your array
looks something like

```javascript
[4, 17, 3, 9]

// instead of [4, 7, 13, 19]
```

Here, you updated the last 3 values, respectively but kept the first value (`4`) intact.
In such a scenario, D3 will use `enter` and `exit` both in combination. Thus,

- `enter` will have 3 new values i.e. **17**, **3** and **9**. Where as,
- `exit` will also have 3 values, corresponding to the old values i.e. **7**, **13** and **19**

The element `4` will remain untouched since it hasn't changed.


Let's look at this complete example in a visual way, using a scatter plot.


## Scatter Plot

Some basic rules that I have set here are

1. All new elements `enter`-ing into the scatter plot will be `green` in colour.
2. All elements `exit`-ing from the scatter plot will be `red` in colour.
3. All elements `update`-ing in the scatter plot will change to `blue`.

**NOTE**: D3 V4 allows you to update the attributes of elements which were updated
as well as added - together.

Here is a basic template of what we will be building upon

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>D3 V4 - Enter, Exit & Update</title>
  <style type="text/css">
    svg     { width: 600px; height: 250px; background: #eee; }
    .enter  { fill: green; }
    .exit   { fill: red; }
    .merge { fill: #333; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="container">
  <h1>Enter Exit and Update</h1>
  <svg id='vis' width="500" height="250"><!-- graphs here are rendered via javascript --></svg>
  <br />

  <!-- To update the data on click -->
  <button>Update Data</button>
</div>

<script src="lib/d3.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  // all the below javascript code goes here.
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

**NOTE**: All the javascript code that is written below will end up being inside
the last `<script>` tag. Don't worry, simply read on until the end of this post. There's a
  consolidated documented code at the end, _to connect the dots - so to speak_ :)

## Begin

Aligning to the three steps above, we will break the code into respective
three steps and then build on it.

### Step 1 - Enter the data (`enter`)

The first thing you do on d3, is to bind the data along with the elements that you
want to create. In this case, we will bind the data to the `<circle>` elements. Something
like,

```javascript
var random_data = [9, 14, 16, 8, 2, 11]
var svg = d3.select('svg')

var c_data = d3.selectAll('circle')
  .data(random_data)
```

As soon as we bind the data using the `.data`, d3 automatically creates the `<circle>`
elements internally, one for each data point. In our case, there will be 6 of them.

You can do a `console.log(c_data)` and check the `_group` property at this point.

At this point in time your `<svg>` is empty since you just loaded the browser. The next
  step to do is `enter` new elements into the blank svg. To do that we use the `.enter`
  selection function, like so.

```javascript
// continuing from above

var c_enter = c_data.enter()
  .append('circle')
    .attr('class', 'enter')   // fill: green

```

This will take the elements generated internally and `enter` the svg. At this point
since the svg was blank, all the 6 data points corresponding to each `<circle>` element
  will be added to the svg.

What you see here, is that we made the circles which `entered` the svg - into green
in colour. Now, Assuming that in some way we alter the data in some way.

### Step 2 - Altered Data (`merge`)

Let's say the data changes from `[9, 14, 16, 8, 2, 11]` to `[19, 4, 6, 18, 2, 11]`
What changed?

- `9` to `19`
- `14` to `4`
- `16` to `6`
- `8` to `18`

in the first four elements. In other words, `updated` the first four elements and let
the last two elements remain the same. But, instead of showing the circles green in colour
we want to see only the updated circles in blue, so that we can identify which circles
updated. So,


```javascript
// continuing from above

var c_merge = c_data.merge(c_enter)
  .attr('class', 'merge')       // fill: blue
```

What just happened here ?

1. We took the `c_data` - which had all the data
2. We took the `c_enter` - which had all the elements which didn't already exist in the svg
3. Merged the two. So, basically, the values, `9`, `14`, `16` and `8` will be updated to corresponding new values
  which will be blue in colour.


### Step 3 - Remove (`exit`)

Finally, assuming that the udpated data might have less number of values, 4 elements
instead of 6 elements for example, then we need to allow them to be removed as well.

Even when you update the existing values, i.e. update `9` to `19` the way d3 works is
it will `exit` `9` and `enter` `19`. In order to do that, you will have to

```javascript
// continuing from above

c_data.exit()
  .remove()
```

We simply removed the elements which aren't necessary anymore using the `remove` method.


### Step 4 - Additional Step

Important point that I will mention here is, in d3 v4, you can add a 2nd parameter
to the `.data` method, which allows d3 to maintain the order of the elements.
See [this link](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md#selections-d3-selection)
to understand in detail. So the `.data` code written earlier will be modified to

```javascript
// modifed from above code

var c_data = d3.selectAll('circle')
  .data(random_data, function(d) { return d; })
```

This will preserve the order of the elements in which they `enter`, `update` and `merge`


## Transitions

In order to understand the entering, updating and existing a little visually on the
graphs, we need to add some transitions. So, let's create a transition

```javascript
var t = d3.transition().duration(750);
```

When applied to selections, this transition `t` will transform into the final result
in about 750 mili seconds - this is all it does. So, let's apply this to the `enter`

### Transitions - Enter

```javascript
var c_enter = c_data.enter() // `enter` the new ones
    .append('g')
      .attr('id', function(d) { return 'id_'+d })
      .attr('class', 'enter')
    .append('circle')
      .attr('r', 0)
      .attr('cx', function(d, i) { return (i * 50) + margin.left })
      .attr('cy', function(d) { return yScale(d) })

  // apply the transition, so that it looks the circles are emerging from the center
  // of their cx value.    
  c_enter.transition(t)
    .attr('r', 5)
```

**NOTE**: Here, I have written `c_enter.transition()` into a separate line because
we will being using `c_enter` later in the code, and `c_enter.transition()` will return
something different - which we don't need.


### Transitions - Merge

```javascript
var c_merge = c_data
  .merge(c_enter)
  .transition(t)
    .attr('class', 'update')  // fill: blue
```

will update the circle's colour to blue in 750 miliseconds.



### Transitions - Exit

```javascript
var c_exit = c_data
  .exit()
  .attr('class', 'exit')
  .transition(t)
    .remove()
```

will change the circle's which are not required, to red and remove them in 750 miliseconds
