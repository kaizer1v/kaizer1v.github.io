What is information architecture? (_5 min read_)

## What?

A way of organising stuff so that it is easy to find and is intuitive. The way you organise stuff implies meaning to it, be it websites or anything in the real world.

There are only 5 ways to organise anything. They are (by)

1. **L**ocation _or_ geography _or_ where
2. **A**lphabet
3. **T**ime _or_ when
4. **C**ategory _or_ similarity _or_ an emotion a music provokes
5. **H**ierarchy _or_ colour

Also, **RANDOM** is not a way of organising things.

Let's look at them each, with a perspective of a Record Store.

## Loction

Any map is a way of organising data by location. A metro map is also a way of organising by location. So is this mental model of [muscles in our body](https://www.biologycorner.com/anatomy/muscles/muscles_labeling/muscles_overall_label_key.jpg)

is a way of organising information based on the location of the body part. So is a [car instruction manual](https://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/motobooks/1970-chevrolet-factory-assembly-instruction-manual-sample-page.jpg)

## Alphabet

A dictionary is probably the best example for this form of organising words. But there are times, when it might not be the best way to organise. For example: in context to the record store - you wouldn't organise all the artists alphabetically - that would be a nightmare to find or discover a new artist.

## Time

At certai times, it might be a good way to tell a nice story or see the information from a different perspective. For example - having a family tree sort out all the people based on the time they were born. That would be nice, but might be very difficult to figure out who how people are related to each other.

Similarly, you cannot have all the street numbers in a city, based on the **time** they were built, that would be a nightmare for postman to deliver post in a city like that.

## Category

Probably the most common way to organise things, are based on their similarities. Typical example would be - items organised by categories at a super market. By doing so, you are automatically buildling an artificial relationship among these artefacts that are being grouped together, which sometimes, could be logical and sometimes not.

## Hierarchy

Popular usage of this form of organising information would be, the EPL football table - where they are sorted by rank / position. In which case, any chart would be sorted hierarchically. A family tree also is typically showcased hierarchically, from the oldest generation to the most recent. Sorting any list by **most popular** or **most recent** (numerically) is also a form of hierarchical information.

Somtimes, it can also mean by colour. For example
