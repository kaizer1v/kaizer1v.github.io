title: Government Acquarium Experience
---
### The Problem
So, I went to this Government Acquarium in Bangalore right next to Cubbon Park. About 10 years back, this acquarium was one of the tourist places to visit in Bangalore. I had visited here as a kid. But Bangalore has grown, populated ever since, but not in terms of the experience of the acquarium, for sure. 

### The Ideal Experience
Adults and chidren visit acquarium to see and learn about the wild, bizarre and wonderful acquatic species that you may never see in your daily life (unless you are a mermaid, in which case, you have no reason to visit the acquarium. Anyway...). Children enjoy seeing these species and get awed. They not only learn about them, but also experience the joy of watching them, so that they can remember or simply get fascinated by watching them. That is how the acquarium experience should be. I simply visited because I was wanting to do something kiddish and also wanted to see the fishes, their colours, wierd defence mechanisms and funny mouths. But, here is what happens.

> Side Note: By writing this article, I am also proposing ways to improve the acquarium experience and tips for the government to make improvements and development.

##The Solution

###Location
The location of the acquarium is quite good and easy for tourists. It lies in the heart of Bangalore, next to Cubbon Park and Visvesvaraya Industrial Museum. According to the wiki page, there are about 1 million visitors at the Museum. Building the acquarium should attract equal number of people as it stands about 100 meters from the entry gate of the museum. This acquarium was established in 1983 and apparently has an exotic cultivable as well as ornamental fish on display. 

###Architecture
The shape of the building is somewhat conical. It looks like this.

The ground floor is a converted government maintainence office, the 1st and the 2nd floor (*shown as escalated ramp in image.*) are acquipped with about 70 fish tanks for visitors to view. The entry fee to view this is only 5 INR. The shape of the building being round makes it convenient for people to view all the fish tanks allowing them to move in a circle. But, at the same time as the crowd increases, the space (diameter) is not enough to hold a lot of people. At a time a single floor can accommodate about 60 - 70 audience.
