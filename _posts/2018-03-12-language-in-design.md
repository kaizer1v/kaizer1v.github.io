*The use of language to design better*

> A picture speaks a thousand words.

In interaction design, language is used to convey concepts and help the user understand
these concepts. It also helps them detemine the idea of the system and thus enables them
to interact with the system better, having a much clearer understanding. Language can be identified as five different dimensions.

## Words

Words as a dimension should convey meaning and the nature of interaction required
by the user. For example, the terms used in the system should
- be familiar to the intended audience. This can be the "language" itself, for example, having the information in "Hindi" instead of "English" would be more accurate for rural/regional users, since they would be able to understand and relate better.
- accurately denote the actions required. Eg: Using the term "Exit" on your gmail account
wouldn't make sense. Rather the term "Logout" represents an accurate meaning.
- be used consistently. Eg: using the same term that you used earlier to convey the meaning you wanted to.
- be presented in the right setting/tone.


## Visual Representation

A user must be comfortable in understanding complex language which cannot be represented using words alone. In such cases, the visual representation of information becomes useful. Thus, visual representation becomes a mean to represent information in the form of
- **icons** can represent more complex information
- **colour contrast** can help them visually highlight information which needs more attention
- **borders** can help distinguish between two separate sets of content
- **spactial** location helps establish visual hierarchy


## Physical Objects / Space

This helps understand the space in which the interactions are going to be defined and can help us better design to give appropriate feedback and execution. Example: A mouse or a keyboard will never be used without a monitor around. Thus, it becomes important to focus more on the *comforting of the hand* than the look of the mouse.


## Time

Time as a dimension helps understand the progress of interactions, overall or the time in which they interact with the system. Example: A film, animation convey a meaning over the duration of the film.


## Behaviour

A user's response to the events or changes in the system, determines the behaviour of interaction, which include the **action** or **operation** or even a **reaction**. Example: an inappropriate or lack of feedback when a user "interacts" with the system will determine his reaction - in which case, he would try and repeat the action or try out an alternate way to achieve his objective.
