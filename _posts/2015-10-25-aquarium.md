*A personal project to redesign the Bangalore aquarium experience.*

### The Problem
So, I went to this Government Aquarium in Bangalore right next to Cubbon Park. About 10 years back, this aquarium was one of the tourist places to visit in Bangalore. I had visited here as a kid. But Bangalore has grown, populated ever since, but not in terms of the experience of the aquarium, for sure. 

### The Ideal Experience
Adults and chidren visit aquarium to see and learn about the wild, bizarre and wonderful aquatic species that you may never see in your daily life (unless you are a mermaid, in which case, you have no reason to visit the aquarium. Anyway...). Children enjoy seeing these species and get awed. They not only learn about them, but also experience the joy of watching them, so that they can remember or simply get fascinated by watching them. That is how the aquarium experience should be. I simply visited because I was wanting to do something kiddish and also wanted to see the fishes, their colours, wierd defence mechanisms and funny mouths. But, here is what happens.

> Side Note: By writing this article, I am also proposing ways to improve the aquarium experience and tips for the government to make improvements and development.

## The Solution

### Location
The location of the aquarium is quite good and easy for tourists. It lies in the heart of Bangalore, next to Cubbon Park and Visvesvaraya Industrial Museum. According to the wiki page, there are about 1 million visitors at the Museum. Building the aquarium should attract equal number of people as it stands about 100 meters from the entry gate of the museum. This aquarium was established in 1983 and apparently has an exotic cultivable as well as ornamental fish on display. 

### Architecture
The shape of the building is somewhat conical. It looks like this.

The ground floor is a converted government maintainence office, the 1st and the 2nd floor (*shown as escalated ramp in image.*) are aquipped with about 70 fish tanks for visitors to view. The entry fee to view this is only 5 INR. The shape of the building being round makes it convenient for people to view all the fish tanks allowing them to move in a circle. But, at the same time as the crowd increases, the space (diameter) is not enough to hold a lot of people. At a time a single floor can accommodate about 60 - 70 audience.

The architecture should allow about 100 people to easily move around within the floor. Ideally, the time taken for a single person on a single floor is about 20 - 30 minutes on average. 20 - 30 minutes for a normal human being, majority of which are/could be children, the aquarium could be improved a lot more by having some interactive, fun information points for kids and students. This will help them learn more about the aquatic life. Simply put, they could start with the evolution of aquatic life and proceed with the evolution and sorting them accordingly and ending with a large dome sized room with glass finish so that one can see all the fishes around (like the one in Singapore).

The inside architecture looks somewhat like this.

### Single Fish Tank
Coming to the most important part of the experience - the fish tank. A single fish tank should have appropriate content and information that is relavent for the viewer / audience. The fish tank had content like

- Name
- Scientific Name / Binomial Name
- Region Found
- Feeds on

From these, some are quite important information, such as name, region found and feeds on. But it could have been put in a differnt way, non-important information like *feeds on* is a non-important information but a necessary one.

###Proposal
A user should be able to retrieve required information whenever required and should be at his disposal. In order to make this possible, contextually, we combined a few existing technologies and created a prototype of enabling a user to retrieve more and interactive information about a particular fish/artifact.

Using the QR code technology, we were able to get information about a given artifact, just like a bar code present on a product stores information like it's price, name etc. The QR code can contain digital media or articles about a particular fish the viewer is viewing. He can then use his smart phone to scan a QR code present near the fish tank and retrieve more information on it.

This enhances the viewer's experience since they would be interacting with the system to retrieve information which inturns connects them to the system. They will be able to share and save the information they are interested in for later reference. This would especially be helpul for viewers who are children or school students.
