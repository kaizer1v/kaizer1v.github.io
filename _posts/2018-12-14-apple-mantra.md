# Apple.

Here's to people who have
always seen things differently.
The ones who follow a vision
not a path
where others perceive
as valuable, you value the first thing
that actually matters.
while others are distracted by the new,
you focus on the significance of
a whole new take.
Even before you could see how,
you never doubted we would
change things
and then we did
together.
Again and again and again and again...

Relentless optimism
is what moves the world forward.
So keep seeing things differently.

Keep trusting that there is always
another way,
a better way,
a bigger way

One that lifts all humanity,
breaks down our barriers
and heals the landscape
you are the difference between
the world as it was
and the better place it will become
and different is the one thing about us
that will always be the same.
