*How cognition affects design thinking.*

-----

The mental action or the process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought,
experience and the senses. Human cognition encompasses process, which are

1. **Attention:**
    The process of selecting only the information which is important and ignoring the rest.
    The two types of processes that enable attention are
    a. Top down - where you only attend to your environment in order to achieve your objective.
    b. Bottom up - where the environment has automatically stimulates it's attention to you.
2. **Memory:**
    The cognition which is responsible for storing and retrieving information.
    There are two types of memory
    a. Short term or Active working memory - which usually has a span of 5 to 9 items, but by the process of chunking one can retain more information in the short term memory.
    b. Long term - is the memory which, by practising can retain more information which can be later retrieved by environmental or situational factors.
3. **Language:**
    The cognition responsible for communicating through symbols, images, written
    text or verbal form. In order to communicate better with the user, by using the
    least un-familier terms, the designer must know the user prior.
4. **Reasoning: **
    The cognitive processes enabling evaluation and generation of logical arguments,
    verification of facts and the assimilation, accommodation and rejection of new information
    on the basis of existing knowledge. There are two types of reasoning
    a. Inductive Reasoning - which uses prior experiences and knowledge to draw a conclusion,
        which not necessarily is true
    b. Deductive Reasoning - which allows you to draw a conclusion based on the
        premises of an argument
5. **Problem Solving:**
    The ability to develop ideas, strategies and behaviours that help one achieve their
    objectives. Problem solving mainly involves three main steps
    a. Goal Directedness
    b. Sub-goal decomposition
    c. Operator selection
6. **Decision Making:**
    The difference between problem solving and decision making is that decision making
    specifially involves in choosing the best possible, avialable option where as the
    former only involves in generating the strategies. Decision making not necessarily
    deals with maximising gains or outputs but sometimes deals with minimising loss.
