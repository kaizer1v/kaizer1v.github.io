description: A data driven way to improve learning comprehension experience for an ed-tech company
---

Zinc Learning Labs is an NY based ed-tech startup that aims to solve for improving reading comprehension in students. The english literacy rate in the US is fairly low and ZLL started off with a mission to improve this. As part of their mission, they started personal tutoring students with a metholody that they built called 'Zincing' and 'Tracking'. This was combined into a web based applicaiton aimed towards schools to be used by teachers as well as students to solve for the lack of reading comprehension and understanding the english language.

The product had a suite of applications like
1. 'Vocab' to help improve vocabulary, learning synonyms and antonyms using spaced repitition for effectiveness.
2. 'Ignition' that combined the skills of 'Zincing' & 'Tracking'.

## What is Ignition?

Ignition as an application is sold to schools where the teachers assign this app to students (middle school) as part of their class exercise. This app starts off by assessing the user's current reading skill level (lexical level in US standards) and then provides personalised passages based on their reading & comprehending level score. The app aims to improve their current assessed level by taking them through a series passages focusing on 4 main skills

1. Use Your Senses - that focuses on pointing out sensory words
2. Make It Real - helping users associate abstract words to something they relate to
3. Pronouns - looking through the reader's perspective
4. ... - 

## The challenge with Ignition

ZLL wanted to improve and enhance the experience of Ignition usage in order to improve the following challenge.

## How I helped ZLL

### 1. Identifying the 'Why'

At first, these numbers were surely indicating the drop in usage, but wasn't indicating why this was happening. The first step as a product designer - I decided to talk to the students themselves.

I structured, scheduled and conducted interviews with 11 students based on their usage of Ignition in order to get their feedback and understand how they perceived the product.

After gathering their feedback, I organised it to something like this

### 2. Prioritising and ideating on identified challenges

When organising and looking into the feedback, it seemed that there were many usability issues that could be solved by simple interface and interaction based changes. These interactions would heed large impact from a usage point of view.

Here are some of the ways I solved particular pain points identified

### 3. Getting feedback

After working on the design changes and buildling an interactive prototype, I again spoke to students whom I had reached out earlier as well as new students to get their first impression on the design changes. It turned out to be amazing

> "I love the colours and the map"
> "This looks so cool, I would love to use this"

### 4. The impact

## Thoughts

Overall, it was very insipring to hear from the users about how I could help enhance their learning experience on an app that they use almost on a daily basis. This was a huge win for me personally. As a designer, that's what motivates and drives me to solve challenging problems. It was also a great experience working with a wonderful team at Zinc Learning Labs.
