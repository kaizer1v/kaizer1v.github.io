<p class="message">
  I am currently somewhere in between an Engineer and a Designer. That said. I have worked as both. Started by designing and developing
  web applications at a small company in Pune. When that shutdown, I left for home where I worked as an ERP consultant for a very short duration
  in a local company implementing Finance module at a manufacturing unit. That seriously wasn't my mug of beer. I joined Symantec (now Veritas)
  as a UX Prototyper.

Symantec really opened up a lot of prospects for me to turn my life around. I chose to dwelve more into design and so joined at Informatica
as a UX designer.

Earlier to my venturing into design, I was a full stack front-end developer. Javascript was my native language. And if you are a Javascript entusiast
or want to know, what all one can do with this language, I highly recommend to read through [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript).

I usually go by the alias 'kaizer1v' everywhere on the web.
